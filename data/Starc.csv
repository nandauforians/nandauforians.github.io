Is that the delivery that changes this Test match? The front foot is fine. Australia are pumped. Goes wide of the crease from around the wicket and directs his bouncer at Shafiq's badge. The key to that delivery was the length. It wasn't pitched too short. More a back of a length, but he was aided by the bounce in this pitch. Shafiq felt he can play instead of duck. It takes the glove and shoulder of the bat and lobs to Warner at gully who backtracks, takes a two-handed overhead catch and throws the ball miles in the air. Sensational delivery to end an even better innings. Fantastic stuff from Shafiq..",,close-in,"136. Asad Shafiq c DA Warner b Starc
