1,1,DM Bravo,bowled,,12,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-1,"Ashwin strikes timber for his first wicket in Tests. Quick offbreak, angled in from round the stumps, hurries off the turf and straightens down the line. Should Bravo have been on the front foot? He stays back and tries to cut though there is no room to work with. He misses and the stumps are in a mess. That was a really poor shot, he was cutting from the leg stump line! 72/3",,,Ashwin
1,2,MN Samuels,caught,MS Dhoni,15,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-2,"?�and he's nailed him with a slider. The last one too held its line, and this wasn't a bad ploy at all to a batsman who stays back and tries to read the spin off the pitch. This one was full, Samuels didn't have much time to realise it was holding its line and poked at it with hard hands. The ball took a thin edge, Dhoni completed his 200th dismissal, and Ashwin's second. Huge blow this, Samuels is as key to the WI cause as Chanders.?�200/5",,Keeper,Ashwin
1,3,R Rampaul,lbw,,12,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-3,"and yet another leg before, Ashwin started to appeal a touch late, slowly at first, but his appeal gained confidence as it grew longer, he had struck Rampaul with a quickish one that hurried in, Rampaul was pushing well outside the line even as it struck him in front of middle?�304/9",,,Ashwin
1,4,KOA Powell,caught,G Gambhir,0,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-4,"1.4?�caught at short cover! Powell went forward and reached for the ball away from his body, playing the cover drive. He couldn't keep it along the ground but hit it hard straight at Gambhir. He didn't catch it on the first attempt and the ball bounced off his hands in front of him. He didn't catch it on the second try either, but grasped it with his left hand on the third while diving forward?�0/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
1,5,DM Bravo,lbw,,12,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-5,"29.2?�Ashwin gets Bravo again, a tactic that Harbhajan uses so well against the left-handers in Tests, tossed up from round the stumps, dragging him forward in defence, he pushes outside the line for the turn, there isn't much and he is rapped on the pad, will have to wait for the replays, looked in line with the stumps in real time, umpire Tucker thought so too, replays show that struck him in line with off, fine decision?�63/5",,,Ashwin
1,6,MN Samuels,bowled,,0,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-6,"29.6?�the carrom ball strikes now, outstanding control he has over this ball, flighted slowly on the off stump line, again drawing another batsman forward, he pushes inside the line this time and well within the pads, the ball goes?�away?�from him, and takes out off stump, the game turns after this double-wicket maiden?�63/6",,,Ashwin
1,7,S Chanderpaul,lbw,,47,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-7,"45.6?�Ashwin has got the big wicket, he had been bowling over the stumps to Chanders while going round the stumps to Darren Bravo, pitched it around leg and got it to turn across Chanders who pushed at it bat and pad together, the ball found the pad and umpire Tucker sent Chanders back?�124/8",,,Ashwin
1,8,DJG Sammy,bowled,,42,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-8,"51.5?�five-for on debut for R Ashwin, he has gone through Sammy with a carrom ball that hardly got up, Sammy was on the back foot and that allowed him no time to get his bat down as it skidded and took off?�157/9",,,Ashwin
1,9,R Rampaul,caught,PP Ojha,18,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-9,"57.3?�Ashwin has his sixth wicket, Rampaul falls on his favoured slog sweep, the ball was a touch too full, he went ahead with the shot, Ojha was placed some way in from the deep midwicket boundary and took it easily?�180/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
2,10,KC Brathwaite,caught,G Gambhir,17,2,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-10,"11.1?�caught at bat pad! Brathwaite came forward to defend but was beaten by the flight, the ball spun into him and lobbed off the pad to Gambhir, who had an easy catch to take. Did that hit the bat, though? I'll need to see a replay. Don't think there was an edge?�30/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
2,11,S Chanderpaul,lbw,,4,2,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-11,18.3?�lbw! Huge wicket for India. There's no doubt about this one. Chanderpaul moved right across his stumps and missed the straighter one because he was playing across the line. He was caught on the crease right in front. That would have hit middle and leg.?�46/4,,,Ashwin
2,12,MN Samuels,lbw,,84,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-12,"117.5?�Ashwin has struck, West Indies' last specialist batsman is gone, Samuels was caught on the back foot by a length delivery, that pitched outside off and struck him on the back leg as the ball tuns past his bat, his bat actually hit the flap of his back pad, so it came down slower than expected, the ball hits him in front of off, it was plumb! and an early finish looms now?�417/7",,,Ashwin
2,13,KAJ Roach,bowled,,1,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-13,"121.4?�where did that come from, Ashwin gets the length ball to drift away before barrelling back in, through the gate and crashes into the top of off and middle, superb delivery, too good for Roach, and this match is quickly winding down?�421/8",,,Ashwin
3,14,AB Barath,caught,MS Dhoni,62,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-14,"52.5?�there's the wicket. The batsmen's concentration hasn't been spot on for the last 15 minutes. Barath presses half forward, and then stays there - neither forward nor back - to a length-ball offbreak. The ball turns and bounces, gets the inside edge onto the pad, and lobs up for an easy catch for Dhoni?�137/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
3,15,KC Brathwaite,caught,V Kohli,68,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-15,"58.6?�Ashwin strikes again. Bat-pad again. Again the well-set batsman. KB is not too pleased with the decision. This one dips on Brathwaite, who is found not to the pitch of the ball. The ball turns, seemingly past the inside edge, and lobs off the pad. Indians have no doubt there is bat involved, the umpire has no doubt bat is involved. KB is not convinced, though. It has kissed the glove on the way. Entirely possible that KB didn't feel it. Top call by the ump?�150/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
3,16,R Rampaul,caught,V Kohli,10,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-16,"174.1?�A straighter one from round the stumps. RR defends for an offbreak, is hit on the pad, and then bat, and taken at silly point. Ashwin starts appealing for leg-before first, which is a very good shout too. The umpire, though, gives him out caught. Two distinct sounds there?�563/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
3,17,MN Samuels,caught,R Dravid,61,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-17,"176.6?�Carrom ball. Gone. Dravid takes a good, low catch. Just short of a length, Samuels moves forward to play for an offbreak, then sees it break away a touch, and instinctively opens the face. The edge is taken, and the low chance is pouched at slip�566/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
3,18,D Bishoo,bowled,,12,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-18,"184.1?�That's a Michelle. Ashwin's second five-for in three Tests. Bishoo tries to slog a full ball, this is an arm ball - full and quick, and takes out the off stump?�590/10",,,Ashwin
3,19,CS Baugh,bowled,,1,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-19,"47.5?�Ojha can't get the perfect 10, but I am sure he won't mind it. The classical offspinner's dismissal. Tossed up outside off, not sure if it drifted away, but Baugh went to drive against the turn and away from the body. The gate was created, and the offbreak burst through. West Indies are having a public nervous breakdown here?�117/6",,,Ashwin
3,20,KOA Powell,lbw,,11,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-20,"49.3?�Huge wicket. Last recognised batsman gone. Bold decision from the umpire. Powell strides forward, this is a length ball, pitches just outside off, goes with the arm. Powell plays for the turn. beaten. The height looks good but it has some distance to travel. Would have clipped leg, but these are the decisions we see given more often these days. The first lbw of the match if I am not mistaken?�120/7",,,Ashwin
3,21,DJG Sammy,caught,MS Dhoni,10,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-21,"57.1?�Sammy is gone. West Indies go deeper into the mire. Short of a length, outside off, open of-side field. Sammy rocks back to force it through the off side. Gets a thick edge, and Dhoni takes a good catch. West Indies 242 for 9, with 66.5 overs to go, minus two for the changeover?�134/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
3,22,D Bishoo,lbw,,0,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-22,"57.2?�He spends precisely a minute on the wicket. That's eight wickets in 95 minutes. All ten to spinners. Shambolic from West Indies. Ashwin bowls the arm ball first up, pitches outside off, short of a length, keeps going from outside off. Hit in front of the stumps, no the back foot. Easy lbw decision?�134/10",,,Ashwin
4,23,EJM Cowan,caught,MS Dhoni,68,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-23,"67.1?�Ashwin has a wicket. Cowan's supreme vigil comes to an end, and Australia are slipping down a familiar slope now. Cowan's been eager to cut Ashwin all day, and hasn't quite figured his drift and variety. This one again, was much too close to the body to cut, but he went for it, and thick-edged it into Dhoni's gloves. Very good take, that. Definite sound, but was there an edge? Oh dear ... Cowan didn't look happy with the decision. HotSpot didn't light up.?�214/6",,Keeper,Ashwin
4,24,BW Hilfenhaus,caught,V Kohli,19,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-24,"105.4?�didn't take long for Ashwin to tempt Hilfy and send him on his way. Tossed up invitingly outside off, it wobbled over the eye line, came down gently and was asking to be muscled across the line. Hilfenhaus obliged, dragging it from wide of off stump towards long-on. It barely travelled three-fourths of the way to the boundary, and Kohli settles under it easily.?�318/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
4,25,NM Lyon,bowled,,6,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-25,"109.6?�Ashwin's bowled Lyon round the legs and Australia are bowled out. Quite a strange dismissal. It was fired in full on off stump, Lyon got drastically across and looked to sweep. He missed, and Ashwin pegged back off stump. All out for 333, triple Nelson ends the innings.?�333/10",,,Ashwin
4,26,NM Lyon,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-26,"53.6?�Ashwin has struck, umpire Erasmus thinks that is going to hit leg stump, it was the flighted carrom ball, pitched on a length, Lyon was playing off the back foot and was caught on the pad, have to wait for replays to see if it was taking leg, yes, replays show Erasmus was spot-on?�166/8",,,Ashwin
6,27,SE Marsh,bowled,,3,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-27,"9.6?�bowled him! The pressure mounts on Marsh after another failure. Ashwin gave the ball some air and pitched it on a good length just outside off. Marsh moved forward to defend but left a large gap between bat and front pad as he did so. He played down the wrong line, for the ball went on with the arm, through the gap, and hit the stumps.?�31/2",,,Ashwin
6,28,EJM Cowan,caught,VVS Laxman,30,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-28,"25.5?�caught at cover! Ashwin tossed this ball up outside off stump, drawing Cowan forward and into the cover drive. The ball dipped and Cowan didn't get to the pitch of it, hitting it hard, flat and low towards the right of the fielder at short cover. VVS Laxman was the man in that position and he did superbly to dive low to hold the chance with both hands. Not bad for a supposedly old man!?�84/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
6,29,PM Siddle,caught,WP Saha,2,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-29,"139.6?�Ashwin strikes with the carrom ball, thin edge through to Saha as Siddle pushes forward?�533/7",,Keeper,Ashwin
6,30,DA Warner,caught,R Ashwin,28,3,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-30,"9.6?�Ashwin strikes, he has troubled both openers, Warner looks to work a full delivery on the leg side, but ends up chipping it down the track, Ashwin moves towards Cowan and takes a neat low catch?�39/1",,Return catch,Ashwin
6,31,EJM Cowan,lbw,,10,3,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-31,"11.4?�that has got to be out, Cowan shuffling again way across, looking to work on the leg side, it carries in with the angle and hits him in front of middle, plumb, that was hitting leg?�40/3",,,Ashwin
7,32,MJ Guptill,caught,V Kohli,2,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-32,"10.1?�the bowling changes sure are paying off! And Ashwin's got the in-form Guptill, tossed up on middle and leg, Guptill was forward to defend, inside edge brushes the pad and goes to Kohli at backward short leg?�29/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
7,33,LRPL Taylor,caught,V Kohli,2,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-33,"12.5?�Appeal for a catch at backward short leg! It's Kohli again. The ball turned and Taylor was trying to tuck it away to the leg side, there was certainly bat on it and all the Indians were confident it was taken cleanly, the umpires are checking, the third umpire has to study a few replays, not very straightforward I can assure you, and he has given it out. It took a few replays. It appeared as if Kohli had his fingers underneath it all along?�35/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
7,34,DR Flynn,lbw,,16,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-34,"18.1?�NZ slip further against the spinners! Flynn was looking positive and had employed the sweep with some success against Ojah, he tried the same against Ashwin, tried to sweep him from the off stump from round the wicket, the umpire reckoned that hadn't spun enough and hence was hitting off stump, he was struck on the base of the pad?�55/4",,,Ashwin
7,35,JS Patel,caught,R Ashwin,10,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-35,"57.3?�appeal for a caught and bowled! Patel's sticking around because it was a very low catch to his left on the dive, it was bowled a touch wide outside off and Patel reached out for an expansive off drive, ended up spooning it to Ashwin's left, he just managed to get his fingers underneath it, the umpires consulted and the third umpire looked at a few replays, clean catch in the end?�153/8",,Return catch,Ashwin
7,36,TA Boult,caught,G Gambhir,4,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-36,"61.2?�Ashwin takes five! Bat-pad catch, tossed up on middle stump, Boult tries to work it away past the packed cordon on the on side, inside edge to the pads and Gambhir plucks it at forward short leg?�159/9",,Close-in,Ashwin
7,37,CS Martin,bowled,,0,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-37,"61.3?�well that was quick, that's a six-for for Ashwin and at the stroke of lunch, bowls it a touch flatter on the off stump, Martin was prodding forward and never looked like getting his bat behind the line, spun back in and hits his stumps?�159/10",,,Ashwin
7,38,LRPL Taylor,bowled,,7,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-38,"48.3?�New Zealand in big trouble now, no DRS doubts over this one, Taylor makes a poor poor decision to leave a delivery from Ashwin, it spins in sharply and takes the top of the off stump, not a replay Taylor will want to see, Ashwin gave that one plenty of air, and got the ball to rip off the track?�105/3",,,Ashwin
7,39,DR Flynn,lbw,,11,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-39,"67.2?�Flynn goes for the sweep, Flynn gone lbw, no doubts about that one, flighted and that one sneaks under Flynn's bat, hit low on the pad in front of middle and off, Ashwin knew that was gone even as he started to appeal, the umpire agrees, India five wickets away now?�142/5",,,Ashwin
7,40,JEC Franklin,caught,V Sehwag,5,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-40,"69.6?�sensational catch from Sehwag, terrific delivery from Ashwin to start with, that spun away after drifting in, plenty of bounce as well, too good for Franklin, who nibbles it through, a faint edge past Dhoni, Sehwag launches himself to the right to pluck a low one-handed effort?�145/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
7,41,CFK van Wyk,lbw,,13,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-41,"77.2?�ten in the game for Ashwin, he loves his home Tests, the carrom ball from Ashwin foxes van Wyk, who went for the reverse-sweep, a shot he used extensively against Narine in the Caribbean, he misses and is struck on the thigh pad, he's gone lbw?�160/8",,,Ashwin
7,42,TA Boult,caught,V Sehwag,0,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-42,"79.2?�Ashwin finding it all too easy here, Sehwag making slip catching looking easy here as well, he had a shocking time at slip in the recent Sri Lanka series, Ashwin sends in a topspinner, Boult plays down the wrong line, edges it through to slip, Sehwag has to bend low to his right to collect that, makes it seem casual. 138 for 3 to 164 for 9?�164/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
7,43,CS Martin,lbw,,0,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-43,"79.5?�it's all over, Martin's legendary batting record continues, a pair for him, Ashwin gets his second six-for of the match, this one struck Martin low on the pads in front of the stumps, not too much doubt there, the carrom ball struck him on the back leg, in front of middle and off, a comprehensive win sealed for India?�164/10",,,Ashwin
8,44,DR Flynn,lbw,,33,1,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-44,"42.2?�and he's fallen for the third time this series to the sweep, and to Ashwin, tossed up offbreak. Flynn wants to sweep, misses, the ball straightens on middle and off, and strikes him on the thigh pad, looked like hitting off, credit to Ashwin for flighting the ball?�196/4",,,Ashwin
8,45,KS Williamson,caught,V Sehwag,13,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-45,"17.6?�Ashwin strikes in his first over, tossed up fullish, turns in a bit, KW pushes forward inside the line, and the edge travels to Sehwag at slip?�69/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
8,46,DR Flynn,caught,V Sehwag,31,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-46,"40.5?�that has been guided straight to Sehwag at first slip, Flynn on the front foot initially as Ashwin tosses it up just outside off, good length, straightens and bounces, he tries to steer it belatedly and finds Sehwag?�140/5",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
8,47,CFK van Wyk,lbw,,31,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-47,"55.4?�Ashwin has got him this time, bending and pushing half-forward, tossed up ball delivered from close to the stumps, sneaks in past bat and hits pad in front of middle and leg, gone?�195/6",,,Ashwin
8,48,JEC Franklin,stumped,MS Dhoni,41,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-48,"61.5?�Ashwin gets another one, Franklin has charged out to a flighted ball, had a swing, been beaten by the sharp turn and bounce, and Dhoni has done the rest?�216/7",,,Ashwin
8,49,TG Southee,bowled,,2,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-49,"65.6?�another Test five-for for Ashwin, flights it high and full, Southee goes for a big drive, the ball spins in and strikes the top of middle and leg?�222/8",,,Ashwin
9,50,NRD Compton,bowled,,9,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-50,"13.3?�gone! There's the first one. A lovely delivery, spins from outside off and turns through the gap between bat and pad into middle stump. Compton didn't quite cover for the spin, but it was a marvelous delivery. The first of many like that, you suspect?�26/1",Yes,,Ashwin
9,51,IJL Trott,caught,CA Pujara,0,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-51,"15.3?�and another! Turning into a late-day procession here. Nicely flighted, turns just enough to take the inside edge into the pad and another catch to short leg?�30/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
9,52,AN Cook,caught,V Sehwag,41,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-52,"39.4?�Gone. Bring on the follow-on. Nicely bowled too. Tossed up on off, much slower than usual, makes his drive, and for a change Cook is not right to the pitch of the ball. The offbreak produces the edge, and Sehwag pouches a sharp low catch. Cook fought hard, concentrated intensely, but is gone now?�80/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
9,53,GP Swann,bowled,,17,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-53,"153.5?�one adventurous shot too many. Swann walks down the wicket, reverses his stance, and tries the switch hit. Ashwin keeps his head, fires it in full and straight, and the middle stump is flattened. England effectively 76 for 9?�406/9",,,Ashwin
10,54,AN Cook,caught,MS Dhoni,122,2,v England,Wankhede,India,23-Nov-12,Test # 2062,ashwin-wkt-54,"86.6?�really well bowled. One of the rare Ashwin overs with no short balls, and he has got the wicket. Flighted, just short of a driving length, Cook defends without reaching its pitch, and the ball turns away to take a thin edge, Punched by Dhoni. A relieved smile on Ashwin's face. His second wicket in his last 85.2 overs. Good to see Kohli pat Cook on his back as he walks back?�274/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
10,55,MS Panesar,caught,Z Khan,4,2,v England,Wankhede,India,23-Nov-12,Test # 2062,ashwin-wkt-55,"121.3?�oh dear Monty! Goes for the sweep again, he connected well but Dhoni had just moved a man to deep midwicket. Did Paneasr see him? Anyway, it was a simple catch.?�413/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
11,56,KP Pietersen,lbw,,54,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-56,"143.2?�goes again, this is straighter, misses and?�given out lbw.?�Looked pretty straight and Ashwin finally strikes. Sweeping those straight balls, you have to hit them and Pietersen simply didn't, was caught in line with middle stump and that almost certainly wasn't doing too much to go down leg?�420/5",,,Ashwin
11,57,JM Anderson,caught,V Sehwag,9,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-57,"167.2?�turn, bounce, and a very good low catch by Sehwag. Short of a driving length, Anderson doesn't come forward, the ball turns appreciably, hits the edge, and Sehwag takes a low catch to his right. All bowlers have takes a wicket off their second ball of the day today?�523/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
11,58,MS Panesar,lbw,,0,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-58,"167.3?�Ashwin will be on a hat-trick if England are required to bat again. Panesar has been suitably angered before he comes to bowl. He has been given out lbw off a thick inside edge. Full ball, middle and off, hits the edge, then the pad, but Dharmasena raises his finger?�523/10",,,Ashwin

Cook wants to finish it off in a hurry, jumps out of the crease, the ball is tossed up slightly wide, he can't reach it, is beaten by the turn, and is stumped. Only the second time he has been stumped in his career. Finally he took it easy then?�4/1",,,Ashwin
11,60,KP Pietersen,caught,MS Dhoni,0,4,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-60,"4.2?�Oh boy. There are things happening here. Is Eden up to its magic? Lovely catch by Dhoni. It is game on here. Offbreak, turning in, Pietersen defends, the ball doesn't turn as much as he expects it to, and the outside edge settles inside Dhoni's gloves?�8/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
12,61,MJ Prior,bowled,,57,1,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-61,"114.6?�bowled'im. Timber. Well bowled Ashwin. An over full of flighted deliveries, bringing the batsman forward all the time. That's the best chance you have on this pitch. Tossed up on of middle and off, Prior plays for the turn, the ball doesn't turn, and knocks back the off stump. Ashwin is pumped?�242/6",,,Ashwin
12,62,AN Cook,caught,MS Dhoni,13,3,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-62,"29.5?�makes him play this time, big appeal for caught behind and?�given out?�the finger goes up straight away but the immediate replay suggests Cook may be unlucky again. He was drawn forward just outside off stump, there was a little turn that look it away from Cook, there was a sound which drew the appeal, it was a straightforward take for Dhoni and the umpire nodded and raised his finger instantly. In fact the replay suggests that Cook missed it by a long distance, another very poor decision from Dharmasena?�48/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
12,63,IJL Trott,caught,V Kohli,143,3,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-63,"134.1?�leg stump, flicked at and it's?�off the face to leg slip,?�a wicket! And India finally remove Trott getting him to flirt at a full delivery from around the wicket into the rough outside leg stump and he got a good load of bat on it put straight to Kohli who held a solid chance at chest height with two hands?�302/4",,Close-in,Ashwin
13,64,EJM Cowan,stumped,MS Dhoni,29,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-64,"14.3?�Ashwin gets the wicket finally. Cowan is gone. Lovely dismissal on all counts. Tossed up, dips on him, Cowan wants to hit another six, not near the ball at all. The ball turns and bounces, Dhoni collects it in front of his chest, and nonchalantly stumps him?�64/1",,,Ashwin
13,65,PJ Hughes,bowled,,6,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-65,"18.3?�bowled'im. Ashwin gets another. Hughes has played on. This is short, turning away giving him the room, but he doesn't play the proper cut. Just pushes at it with his arms, and gets an inside edge onto the leg stump. Had he played the proper full-blooded cut, he would have got four for this. Ashwin won't mind it, though. He has bowled some superb deliveries earlier, which have not got him wickets?�72/2",,,Ashwin
13,66,SR Watson,lbw,,28,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-66,"34.4?�and Ashwin strikes soon after lunch. Done in by the low bounce. Short of a length, outside off, he is going back but this skids through. It would have hit the stumps for sure, but might or might not have hit him just outside the line of off. The replays are not entirely conclusive, but it looks more outside the line than in?�126/3",,,Ashwin
13,67,DA Warner,lbw,,59,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-67,"36.4?�Warner has played with fire far too often and for far too long. Continues staying back to fullish deliveries. He has been misjudging the length too often to have carried on with this innings. Goes back deep into the crease. The trajectory is flat all right, but the length is much fuller. He is late in bringing the bat down, and is caught dead in front?�131/4",,,Ashwin
13,68,MS Wade,lbw,,12,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-68,"46.6?�all five for Ashwin so far. Tossed up on middle and leg, straightens after that. Wade plays down the wrong line altogether, and is hit in front. That's pretty adjacent, although Wade doesn't seem happy when walking back?�153/5",,,Ashwin
13,69,MC Henriques,lbw,,68,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-69,"89.2?�Ashwin has six out of six. Henriques out sweeping. This is a big offbreak, has beaten the bat, and seems to have hit him in front of off. Was it turning too far? I thought so, but on replays this looks closer?�304/6",,,Ashwin
13,70,NM Lyon,caught,V Kohli,3,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-70,"132.6?�finally Dharmasena raises his finger. Don't think he was left with an option. Offbreak, middle and leg, swept away, gets an edge fine, and Kohli takes a superb catch to his right at backward short leg. Ashwin's best figures in first-class cricket?�380/10",,Close-in,Ashwin
13,71,SR Watson,caught,V Sehwag,17,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-71,"15.6?�Ashwin gets Watson with the last ball before lunch. The crowd erupts too. This is what offspinners should be bowling on this pitch. Flighted, slower through the air, wider outside off, and then it dips. Watson, who wants to play a forward-defensive, discovers he is not close to the pitch of the ball, and the ball turns and bounces to go off the glove or the shoulder of the bat for an easy catch to slip?�34/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
13,72,EJM Cowan,lbw,,32,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-72,"28.6?�Dharmasena's finger finally goes up, and it is a superb call again. Cowan is disappointed with the call because presumably he thinks he has been given out caught bat-pad, but he is out lbw here. This i what happened: quick deliver, pitched middle, straightened, and hit him in front of middle. In between, Cowan's bat hit the boot, and Vijay went up for the catch too. However, officially he has been given out lbw, and it looks pretty straight on that count. In fact the only thing that could have saved him was an edge, and he would have been out in that case too?�64/2",,,Ashwin
13,73,MJ Clarke,lbw,,31,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-73,"49.3?�Huge wicket of Clarke arrives. It took a really naughty trick from the pitch to get him. Flighted but short, Clarke goes back to cut, but it spins sharply and stays low, and hits his back pad just in front of off. Was it spinning too much? I doubt. For he is on the back foot and there isn't a long way to go?�131/6",,,Ashwin
13,74,JL Pattinson,caught,V Sehwag,11,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-74,"63.1?�Sehwag takes a low catch for a change. Ashwin goes over the wicket, this one turns from around leg-stump line, Pattinson punches, gets the edge with the sharp turn, ad Sehwag pouches a sharp one by his toes?�161/8",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
13,75,MA Starc,caught,SR Tendulkar,8,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-75,"65.5?�Ashwin gets a second five-for for the match. No. 12 for him. Starc was not going to die wondering, but he was going to die nonetheless. This is tossed up high by Ashwin, too much for Starc to resist, the ball grips the surface, makes him mis-hit, and Tendulkar takes an easy catch at deepish mid-on?�175/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
14,76,PJ Hughes,caught,MS Dhoni,19,1,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-76,"21.2?�Ashwin strikes, he's conceded a run and is into his sixth over, and has now taken out Hughes, but what a take from Dhoni, on the second attempt, tossed up, good length, middle and off, spins away, Hughes cuts, edges, it pops out of Dhoni;s gloves, but the keeper recovers to throw himself to his left and take the ball even as it comes down?�63/4",,Keeper,Ashwin
14,77,DA Warner,bowled,,26,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-77,"19.6?�the change of angle works for Ashwin. Warner tries to sweep it as this is pitched outside leg, but it is that awkward sweeping length between the too full and lenght region. Warner misses, and the ball turns to hit the prone leg stump. Dhoni's reaction suggests it was his idea to get Ashwin to move over the stumps?�56/1",,,Ashwin
14,78,PJ Hughes,bowled,,0,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-78,"23.3?�Australia are sweeping themselves out of the Test. That angle is working like a charm. Tossed up outside leg, Hughes looks to sweep, but he has got too far across, and is hit on the glove, and the ball rolls onto the stumps. Ashwin can't believe Hughes has taken the bait too?�56/2",,,Ashwin
14,79,GJ Maxwell,lbw,,8,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-79,"54.1?�that's plumb lbw. Carrom ball. Lovely use of it. Using it for the lesser batsmen and not for the top order. Anyway this wicket was a-coming. Maxwell has hardly looked assured. This drifts in towards the pads, is full, and Maxwell thinks he can flick it square. He has not read the ball at all. It pitches, turns the other way, and hits the back pad in front of middle and off. Very good use of the variation: sparing and against a lesser batsman?�123/7",,,Ashwin
14,80,MS Wade,caught,V Sehwag,10,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-80,"58.1?�falling like nine pins here. Will Australia declare now? Tossed up wide outside off, Wade pushes in hope, gets a soft edge, Sehwag accepts it with glee at slip?�130/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
14,81,JL Pattinson,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-81,"66.6?�it's all over at the HCA Stadium. Ashwin gets five. Full, straight and flat. Beats the inside edge, it is deemed to be going straight on to hit the stumps. Pitches in front of leg, does it straighten enough? Dharmasena thinks so?�131/10",,,Ashwin
15,82,EJM Cowan,caught,V Kohli,86,1,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-82,"77.6?�finally Cowan is caught. Finally Kohli holds one. And finally Ashwin gets reward for some superb bowling today. Again tossed up nicely, dipping on Cowan, who defends from the crease. The ball pitches full around middle and off, then turns away, takes the edge, and Kohli swallows the sitter at slip?�198/4",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
15,83,XJ Doherty,lbw,,5,1,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-83,"141.5?�India will have to bat before lunch. Tossed up on middle and leg, holds its line a bit, hits him in front of leg. Did it straighten enough? I don't think so, but he has been given?�408/10",,,Ashwin
15,84,PJ Hughes,lbw,,69,3,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-84,"48.3?�that looks like a bad decision. Easily missing the leg stump. Short of a length, middle and leg, doesn't straighten enough. Given. A strange one from Dar. Even the impact was possibly outside leg?�123/6",,,Ashwin
15,85,BJ Haddin,lbw,,30,3,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-85,"71.1?�carrom ball. Gets the breakthrough. Very well bowled. The legbreak at 90ks, pitches middle and leg, Haddin hasn't picked it, has his outside edge beaten, and is hit plumb in front. This is not a tailender; he has done Haddin in with the carrom ball?�179/9",,,Ashwin
16,86,EJM Cowan,bowled,,38,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-86,"32.6?�and this is at least the third batsman this series that Ashwin has bowled around the legs on the sweep, and bowling from over the stumps. So this is no lucky dismissal. He has planned this. Tossed up outside leg, turning towards the stumps. Cowan is on the sweep, misses the line, and is bowled. On the other hand, it is pretty soft for Australia to keep on losing wickets in this manner?�106/3",,,Ashwin
16,87,MS Wade,caught,M Vijay,2,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-87,"40.4?�down the wicket to kick this away, but the extra bounce hits him high on the pad. Silly point catches it, the fielders go up in unison, Aleem Dar has no hesitation in giving him. I think Wade might be unlucky here. I haven't seen a clear edge. Perhaps the umpire was done in by how high this went, perhaps he was done in by the proximity of the bat to the pad. Oh it's the bat hitting the pad that has created the second noise. Wade can consider himself unlucky?�117/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
16,88,MG Johnson,bowled,,3,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-88,"53.6?�Johnson is stunned. He has seen a ghost. Actually he has just not picked a carrom ball. This is a length ball, on off, Johnson thinks he can leave it alone, but the ball turns against the angle and knocks the off stump over. He just stands there stunned for various seconds. Dhoni's celebratory reaction suggests this is a pre-discussed dismissal. For many seconds, Johnson thought it was a stumping appeal. Then he asks, ""Bowled?""?�136/7",,,Ashwin
16,89,SPD Smith,caught,AM Rahane,46,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-89,"81.2?�sharp offbreak, sharp catch. Rahane's first Test contribution with no ""sub"" next to his name. This is quick, dipping, and Smith is nowhere near it in defence. The ball is allowed time to turn and hits the inside edge for a quick catch to Rahane at short leg?�189/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
16,90,PM Siddle,bowled,,51,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-90,"102.1?�bowled'im. Ashwin has a five-for. Sensational stats: nine five-fors in 16 Tests. Finally breaks through Siddle's defence. This is a natural variation from the wicket. An offbreak, on a length outside off, Siddle defends, but the ball doesn;t turn as much as the balls have been turning, and the off stump is flattened?�243/9",,,Ashwin
16,91,PJ Hughes,lbw,,6,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-91,"13.4?�lbw! But was that hitting the stumps? Ashwin drifted the ball into the left-hander from round the wicket, pitching on leg stump and ripping the offbreak sharply. Hughes came forward to defend and was beaten by the turn. The ball hit his back pad in front of off stump but I think the turn would have taken it past off stump. The umpire did not think so?�41/3",,,Ashwin
16,92,PM Siddle,stumped,MS Dhoni,50,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-92,"46.3?�Siddle's been stumped! Clever bowling from Ashwin. Australia have been dismissed. Siddle charged Ashwin, and perhaps that was becoming predictable. Ashwin bowled the ball wide outside off stump, Siddle lunged at it but it was out of reach. Dhoni was ready and waiting too, collecting quickly and lunging back towards the stumps to break them with Siddle well out?�164/10",,,Ashwin
17,93,V Permaul,caught,R Ashwin,14,1,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-93,67.6?�caught and bowled!

Chanderpaul's played down the wrong line and the ball's clipped off stump. It was the quicker ball and it pitched outside off stump and skidded on while kolding its line, Chanderpaul played back and tried to defend. He just missed it.?�233/9",,,Ashwin
17,95,KOA Powell,lbw,,36,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-95,"30.4?�lbw! That's right in front. Ashwin flighted the ball into the left-hander from round the wicket, Powell could have been forward to that but he played back. The ball pitched around off and middle, straightened a little, and kept very low to beat Powell's defence and hit the pad.?�101/2",,,Ashwin
17,96,DM Bravo,caught,RG Sharma,37,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-96,"34.3?�caught at point! The well-set Bravo is gone to a loose shot. Ashwin pitched outside off and got the ball to bounce a bit more. Bravo went back to cut and hit it in the air, the fielder dived forward at point to take the catch as the ball dipped on him?�120/4",,InField,Ashwin
17,97,TL Best,caught,PP Ojha,3,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-97,51.3?�caught at deep midwicket! Best has a wry smile as he walks off the field. Ashwin flighted the ball beautifully and it dipped on Tino and beat him in the flight. He slogged across the line and mis-hit it straight to Ojha on the boundary?�159/9,,Outfield,Ashwin

There was some bounce again in this delivery, pitching on middle and turning away. He plods forward but played at it with hard hands, as the edge flies to gully.

18,100,DJG Sammy,caught,RG Sharma,0,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-100,"48.6?�but now he's gone! Horrible shot as he goes for a wild slog and the West Indies captain goes as soon as he came. It was a simple off spinner, pitching on middle and turning only a bit. But playing across the line, he gets a leading edge that went straight in the air and Rohit Sharma settles under it to give Ashwin his 100th Test wicket, the fifth quickest to the mark?�162/7",Yes,InField,Ashwin

Powell gives it away by lofting it straight to long off, the lone man in the deep. He came charging down the pitch and had to wait a little longer as Ashwin delivered it at a slower pace, and that probably messed up his timing. Shami at long-off came running forward and took a good, low diving catch?�15/1",,Outfield,Ashwin
18,102,DM Bravo,caught,M Vijay,11,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-102,"12.2?�and they are falling in a heap!

Quite bizarre really, a comfortable forward defence to a length ball and Ballance ends up walking off! The delivery didn't do anything unusual at all, maybe a little bit of bounce but nothing that should cause alarm, it's just a lazy bit of cricket from the batsman playing with quite hard hands?�201/3",,Close-in,Ashwin

That hung in the air just outside off, drawing Tamim forward for the drive. It dipped and spun sharply past his outside edge and Saha was lightning-quick getting the bails off, and it looks like the tip of his toe is a couple of millimeters outside the crease. That looks out to me. And the third umpire agrees. Bangladesh lose their first wicket, and it's the big one, Tamim. 27/1",,,Ashwin

This one's a touch shorter but too close to cut, and it bounces a touch extra and clips the top edge through to Saha, who takes it well, close to the bat.

Turn and bounce from outside off and it gets big on Litton, who tries to tuck it away into the leg side and inside-edges onto thigh pad, and it pops up to the left of Rohit, who stretches out an arm from leg slip to pouch it one-handed. Litton walks, and that's the end of an excellent little innings on debut. 232/8",,Close-in,Ashwin

Sanga walks off a Test field for one final time. Indian fielders line up to shake Sanga's hand. Quite a mark of how popular a man he was. Percy is on the field with a Sri Lanka flag. Sanga holds his arms aloft, makes no fuss, and walks off quickly. Ashwin has bowled beautifully again. On a length, outside off, dipping on him, not within the reach of Sanga's defence. Then it turns, takes the edge of the defensive bat, and settles with gully. Thank you, Kumar 33/2",,Close-in,Ashwin

Ashwin serves a reminder of his class as an offspinner. Lovely dip on the ball as Thirimanne shimmies out of the crease. He is early into the push, he is not close to the ball, this is recipe for disaster. He is looking to work this to leg, gets a leading edge, which has gone quickly to silly point, but Pujara - the substitute fielder - has pouched this. It hits the wrists and gets stuck in the armpit 106/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
27,140,KTGD Prasad,caught,A Mishra,0,4,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (PSS),Sri Lanka,20-Aug-15,Test # 2177,ashwin-wkt-140,"36.4 and that is a tailender's shot. Prasad has jumped out of the crease and hoicked. Not close to the turning ball, and edges a skier to Mishra at mid-on 114/7",,InField,Ashwin

This was going high, nearly ready to lob him. He was leaping up, his left hand was stretched up as high as it could go and created the rebound for him, which he was alert enough to take. Lovely, loopy delivery on middle, Thirimanne lunges forward and closes the face, playing against the turn, and there is turn. He might have gotten away with it, seeing as the ball seemed set to soar over the fielder, but Rahul did so well there 107/5",,Close-in,Ashwin

A little altercation between Kusal and the Indians. Ashwin is trying to broker peace and calm the batsman down. Bowled well, looping the ball up. It was on leg stump so the threat was not as much, Kusal goes for a reverse sweep, connected well but has popped the catch to Rohit at point. 242/6",,InField,Ashwin

Tossed up and angled in, but it is the length that makes Herath fall over himself. Did not think it would be that full, and yorks himself. Struck on the front toe, I think, but might it have been going down? 257/8",,,Ashwin
28,145,KTGD Prasad,caught,STR Binny,6,4,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,28-Aug-15,Test # 2179,ashwin-wkt-145,"83.5 goes straight up, and Binny takes the reverse cup at mid-off, I think. This was always on the cards, with the tailending trying to hit every ball into the neighboring country. This time he gets under it a little too much. Handsome height, but no distance at all 263/9",,InField,Ashwin
29,146,S van Zyl,lbw,,5,2,v South Africa,Mohali,India,05-Nov-15,Test # 2186,ashwin-wkt-146,"6.4 here comes the one! He has not played a shot at that and he is dead. van Zyl can't Zyl. This was tossed up on off, and strangely, the batsman lets it go through. Probably he was expecting it to turn away or maybe he just misread the line. Whatever it was, a big big error. India have one in the bag. 9/1",,,Ashwin

29,148,HM Amla,stumped,WP Saha,43,2,v South Africa,Mohali,India,05-Nov-15,Test # 2186,ashwin-wkt-148,"45.2 oh, they've got the other one, Amla is beaten as he comes out of the crease and the ball bounces off Saha to hit off stump and he's stumped! Amla came way out of the crease to take the ball on the full, it turned from length and sneaked through the gap between bat and pad as Amla drove, Saha could not collect the ball but it went off his chest to hit top of off and there went the bail! 105/4",,,Ashwin

Tossed up outside off, Vilas goes for the sweep and the ball takes a top edge to got high behind square. It hasn't gone straight to Jadeja so he runs back and tumbles but catches with both hands 107/5",,InField,Ashwin

That is a five-for for Ashwin and his 150th Test wicket too.

Beautiful delivery - in that it has no tricks. Absolutely nothing. Just a straight ball, tossed up to let the batsman's nerves fester, pitched on middle and on a good length to make sure he has to play. Van Zyl, as his team-mates had done in Mohali and failed - plays for the turn and is rapped in front of the stumps. Simple enough call for umpire Kettleborough 15/1",,,Ashwin

The soft signal is out! Things happening the moment the in-form bowler is on. And Ashwin has defeated another batsman in the flight. The crowd has erupted into screams of ""ABD."" (But Amla is their No. 4) Faf was down the track, trying to take advantage of his ners to get off the mark. But the ball dipped on him, the batsman went on with his flick, and gets an inside edge. The ball goes almost hugging the turf, Puj has to stay low, get lower and he has taken it in his fingertips. There seems to be some about of the ball not under the fingers, but the third ump punches the red light. 15/2",,Close-in,Ashwin

This was coming low, he had to push forward, go to his left a touch too, and shovel the ball up into his hands. Not even the slightest hint of doubt. Duminy was on the back foot again, trying to play that push through the covers. But he was a little too legside of the ball, I think, and this one turned. Took the outside edge and the record-breaking Rahane proves his mettle again 120/5",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
30,157,M Morkel,caught,STR Binny,22,1,v South Africa,Bengaluru,India,14-Nov-15,Test # 2188,ashwin-wkt-157,"58.5 top edge, it's a steepler and Stuart Binny has taken a blinder! Spreads his hands at the outfield and revels in his success. This is a tossed up delivery with a hint of room. Nice and slow too to get the tailender to lose his head and swipe across the line. Which Morkel does. The ball ends up around the long-on area, when it was intended for midwicket. Classic symptom of hitting against the turn. Binny is the man running back, craning his neck back to track the ball. Judges it to perfection and takes with both hands 214/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
31,158,S van Zyl,caught,AM Rahane,0,2,v South Africa,Nagpur,India,25-Nov-15,Test # 2189,ashwin-wkt-158,"3.1 and there is the first! Ashwin strikes. And he has struck relatively early in this session. Fullish length on off, van Zyl looks to defend but gets a thick outside edge which easily carries to Rahane at first slip. Nicely bowled, pitched and that one spun 4/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin

Good length delivery outside off, Amla goes down early for the sweep but is through the shot too early. The ball hits his arm and then as the bat finishes its swing, the ball hits the back of the bat near the toe end, and lobs up. It bounces off the keeper's shoulder and pops up tamely for Rahane at first slip. Amla tucks his bat under his armpit and walks off, doesn't wait for the umpire to raise the finger. Surprising to see Amla not adjusting to the pace of the pitch, the ball just has not come on to the bat as the batsmen have expected 12/4",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin

Tossed up on off, a bit of spin and Morkel looks to play against the spin, off the outside half and Ashwin does not have much to do to take the catch. He does so quite well and this is the lowest total India have bowled a side out for. 79/10",,Return catch,Ashwin
31,163,S van Zyl,caught,RG Sharma,5,4,v South Africa,Nagpur,India,25-Nov-15,Test # 2189,ashwin-wkt-163,"7.4 oh no, loose shot. He will not be happy at all. Nicely tossed up from Ashwin, enticing a drive and van Zyl obliges, goes for it but hits it in the air and straight to short cover.

Slider on middle, Elgar comes forward and prods yet again but he gets a thick inside edge on to his pad and then just lobs up for silly point to take. Struck him in front of middle so no edge and that could have been lbw as well. The umpire gives him and India have their first of the day, Elgar does not want to go but that was a huge inside edge. Has to make his way off 40/3",,,Ashwin

No doubt about the decision, was that the carrom ball? very well done from Ashwin, he has deceived a terrific batsman at the peak of his abilities. pitches on off, moves a hint away from AB who does not pick it and is struck right in front of middle and off. Easy decision for the umpire 58/4",,,Ashwin
31,166,JP Duminy,lbw,,19,4,v South Africa,Nagpur,India,25-Nov-15,Test # 2189,ashwin-wkt-166,"81.1 and Duminy has to go. Slid straight on and Duminy did not offer a shot, the ball goes on with the arm and strikes Duminy in front of off and middle. The umpire is quick to raise his finger and with that, any hopes of a SA comeback. Regulation offbreak which did not turn. But with a new ball, that happens, did Duminy misjudge that completely? Doesn't matter, he is gone 164/7",,,Ashwin

There may have been just a tiny deflection. The umpire thinks and thinks and then raises the finger.

May have been the carrom ball or the slider but the ball drifts on and snakes through the gap between bat and pad to clatter into leg stump. Morkel did not pick that.

32,170,KJ Abbott,lbw,,4,2,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-170,37.5 lbw! Ashwin finally has one as well. Abbott went on the back foot this time to a ball that pitched just outside off and went straight on with the arm. He tried to defend but missed and was hit plumb in front 84/7,,,Ashwin
32,171,Imran Tahir,caught,KL Rahul (sub),1,2,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-171,"49.3 another slog from Tahir and another mis-hit, lofting the ball towards deep midwicket, Rahul rushes in to catch the ball and then has to backpedal to get under the ball, he is moving back swiftly as the ball reaches him and falls over as he catches it. 121/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
32,172,D Elgar,caught,AM Rahane,4,4,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-172,"3.6 caught at slip! Ashwin strikes with the new ball. Elgar stays in his crease, and drives forward at a flighted ball that drifts into him from around the wicket, pitches on middle and spins away sharply from the left-hander. He wasn't close to the pitch of the ball and Rahane caught the outside edge at first slip 5/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
32,173,T Bavuma,bowled,,34,4,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-173,"42.4 bowled him! Bavuma has lost his off stump. Muted celebrations from India, but isn't that a superb ball from Ashwin? Lovely flight outside off stump, drifts into the right-hander and then straightens past the outside edge of Bavuma's back-foot defence. After lots of blocking, he's undone again because he leaves his off stump exposed while defending from the crease. He's played really well though, considering he was opening for the first time in this Test 49/2",,,Ashwin
32,174,JP Duminy,lbw,,0,4,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-174,"124.2 LBW! That is plumb, AB watches the resistance crumble. Duminy goes back and across and is hit in front of middle and leg. That would have gone on to clip leg stump. Not as plumb as I thought on first glance but out enough. That ball kept a bit low 112/5",,,Ashwin
32,175,AB de Villiers,caught,RA Jadeja,43,4,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-175,"139.1 he's got him! He's got AB, that has to be the game. AB's defence has been broken by a sharp, spinning and bouncing offbreak. That ball spat, viciously from a good length, rearing up at AB who had moved across his crease to defend. It pinged off those battered gloves and popped up to leg slip. Ecstasy for India. AB falls off his 297th delivery 136/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
32,176,M Morkel,bowled,,2,4,v South Africa,Delhi,India,03-Dec-15,Test # 2191,ashwin-wkt-176,"143.1 bowled him! Ashwin has taken the final wicket, fittingly, to complete a five-for! Huge celebrations break out in the middle and in the stumps. Morkel left the ball go outside off but it did not spin away, it went on with the arm from around the wicket and clipped off stump 143/10",,,Ashwin
33,177,R Chandrika,caught,WP Saha,31,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-177,"35.5 very good work from bowler and keeper. Loads more revs on the ball, and the seam whirs around, while being bolt upright and pointing at leg slip. Chandrika is sucked into playing a flick shot on the front foot, and that's when the ball dips, seems to take an inside edge, brushes the pad and goes through to the wicketkeeper. Saha doesn't take it on the first grab, but he recovers it on the third. 88/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
33,178,J Blackwood,caught,V Kohli,0,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-178,"37.5 taken at short midwicket, and a pair for Blackwood. Gorgeous bowling from Ashwin again, giving the ball flight to draw the batsman forward and to make him think he can attack it. But then he makes it dip, which means when Blackwood plays the flick even with the roll of the wrists the ball goes up in the air. Good on Kohli to keep a short midwicket, it's him at that position, diving away to his left 92/4",,InField,Ashwin
33,179,MN Samuels,bowled,,50,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-179,"41.5 ripper! Samuels has played down the wrong line, worried about a repetition of big spinning offbreak earlier in the over. Tosses it up outside off, the drift away from the bat does Samuels in. Otherwise the turn would have been countered by the full face of the bat. As such the ball pitches further away from him outside off and beats his outside edge 101/5",,,Ashwin
33,180,RL Chase,caught,KL Rahul (sub),8,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-180,"45.4 gorgeous bowling again! Dip this time to knock Chase out. He was lunging forward, prepared to block with hard hands. Had he reached the pitch of the ball, he may well have. But this one eludes him and is therefore able to turn, bounce, take the top of the bat and settle in KL Rahul's hands. Sharp, low catch from the substitute 106/6",,Close-in,Ashwin
33,181,JO Holder,bowled,,16,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-181,"53.2 that will feel sweet! First five-for outside Asia. Second time he has a hundred and a five-for in the same match. Come hit me, the ball says as he lobs it up outside off, Holder falls into the trap, goes for the cover drive, leaves a big gap between bat and pad and the leg stump takes a beating 132/8",,,Ashwin
33,182,D Bishoo,caught,CA Pujara,45,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-182,"77.3 whipped straight at midwicket. Tossed up on the pads, Bishoo goes for another aggressive stroke and doesn't mind the field. Pujara was there, and it went straight to him 227/9",,InField,Ashwin
33,183,ST Gabriel,bowled,,4,3,v West Indies,North Sound,West Indies,21-Jul-16,Test # 2207,ashwin-wkt-183,77.6 plays inside the line and gets his off stump pegged back. That is India's first innings win in the West Indies. A shortish ball pitches outside off and is virtually allowed to go past him by Gabriel playing down the wrong line 231/10,,,Ashwin
34,184,J Blackwood,lbw,,62,1,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-184,"25.3 Ashwin has struck in the last over before lunch but I think this is turning too much to be out lbw. I am afraid this is not the smartest decision. This offbreak has hit him in front, but is turning appreciably. You rarely see them given out lbw. Back to what happened, though. Nicely tossed up, dips on him, is not in his driving range so Blackwood defends. This turns sharply from just outside off, seems to have beaten the inside edge. Given by Aleem Dar. Hawkeye says this is kissing the outside of the top of the leg stump. Oh well 88/4",,,Ashwin
34,185,MN Samuels,caught,KL Rahul,37,1,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-185,"29.3 beautiful bowling. Samuels falls after a promising start to the innings. Wonderful bowling, though. He tosses this up higher after being hit for the six. And this one dips on him, and Samuels's front foot is stuck after his initial movement. The dip, though, requires him to be further down the pitch to play a forceful shot. Now that there is distance between bat and ball, there is enough time for it to turn, take the inside edge and lob up for a simple catch to short leg 115/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
34,186,SO Dowrich,caught,WP Saha,5,1,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-186,"35.1 strange dismissal. Not sure of his off stump there. Dowrich sees this offbreak is short and outside off so makes up his mind to leave it alone. Then he sees the ball turn, and feels compelled to protect his stump. the belated and uncommitted attempt to play at it results in results in his toe-ending it through to Saha. Oh the replays show his attempt to play at this is uncommitted because his bat is stuck momentarily in the flap of the pad on its downswing 127/6",,Keeper,Ashwin
34,187,D Bishoo,caught,S Dhawan,12,1,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-187,"43.3 and Ashwin has another. Bishoo loses patience. The backward short leg has just moved to short fine leg. This is tossed up teasingly outside off, Bishoo finally goes for the sweep, and Ashwin's bounce takes the top edge for a simple semi-skier for Dhawan at short fine leg 151/8",,InField,Ashwin
34,188,JO Holder,caught,KL Rahul,13,1,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-188,"45.5 Five-for No. 18 in 34 Tests. Holder looks to leave his crease to come to the pitch of the ball, but he has made a highly tentative half movement forward. Ashwin needs to second invitations to turn the ball back in, take the inside edge onto the pad and take another bat-pad wicket 158/9",,Close-in,Ashwin
34,189,J Blackwood,caught,CA Pujara,63,3,v West Indies,Kingston,West Indies,30-Jul-16,Test # 2211,ashwin-wkt-189,"33.3 it must have been good but it's over now. Good while it lasted, but didn't last long enough to change the course of the Test. Ashwin - hit for a four and six already by Blackwood - shows he is too good for one-dimensional batting in Test cricket. Every time he has slowed the ball down, he has had Blackwood either jabbing or groping. This time the ball dips to create gap between the bat and the pitch of the ball, it then turns to take the inside edge of the bat onto the pad, and Pujara dives forward and to his left at short leg to take a sensational catch centimetres from the ground. Umpire Gould rules the catch clean without the help of replays. And clean it is 141/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
35,190,KC Brathwaite,caught,WP Saha,64,2,v West Indies,Gros Islet,West Indies,09-Aug-16,Test # 2215,ashwin-wkt-190,58.1 Brathwaite has been caught down the leg side. WI's overnight batsmen (or rather the batsmen from the second day) have been dismissed within the first hour. Pitches on middle and breaks down the leg side with extra bounce. The opener attempts a leg-side tickle. The ball kisses the glove and Saha gobbles it up smartly 135/3,,Keeper,Ashwin
35,191,ML Cummins,caught,WP Saha,0,2,v West Indies,Gros Islet,West Indies,09-Aug-16,Test # 2215,ashwin-wkt-191,"102.3 turn and bounce accounts for Cummins. Tossed up on off and breaks away, Cummins prods and nicks it, Saha completing another smart catch, grabbing it in front of his chest this time. It just flicked the glove on its way to the keeper. Falls for a 21-ball duck 221/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
35,192,AS Joseph,caught,Mohammed Shami,0,4,v West Indies,Gros Islet,West Indies,09-Aug-16,Test # 2215,ashwin-wkt-192,"42.1 Ashwin lodges himself into the wickets column now. Joseph bags a pair on debut. Ashwin lobs this offbreak up on middle. Invites the big hit from Joseph. He shovels it in the air. Skied off the inside half. Shami initially misjudged it running in from the deep. He then recovers, dives forward, and completes the low catch at midwicket. Ashwin has a wry smile on his face. India one away from wrapping up the series 95/9",,InField,Ashwin
36,193,DM Bravo,bowled,,10,1,v West Indies,Port of Spain,West Indies,18-Aug-16,Test # 2218,ashwin-wkt-193,"14.4 what a comeback by Ashwin! This is as good a delivery as you will see for an offspinner. Drift and turn beats Bravo. This one pitches on middle, by which time Bravo is already committed into a defensive shot, but he doesn't account for the ball that spins past his bat face to hit off stump. The bat was facing midwicket as he looked to push at that delivery. 48/2",,,Ashwin
37,194,TWM Latham,lbw,,58,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-194,"51.5 goes straight on! These aren't tricks, folks. This is pure skill from Ashwin. Putting a lot more body into his action, which helps him drift the ball into the left-hander from around the stumps. And that drift happens late. Latham is prodding forward, defending outside the line and his front pad is ripe for attack 159/2",,,Ashwin
37,195,KS Williamson,bowled,,75,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-195,"55.4 he makes sure it needs a bit of magic to get him out, and Ashwin has produced it. You little beauty! He had to go back, because the length was a touch short. It was quite a distance outside off too, so he wouldn't have expected to be bowled. Williamson was shaping to pat it through cover, but Ashwin has given this so much rip and the pitch gives it a bit of love too. As good a dismissal as an offspinner can hope 170/4",,,Ashwin
37,196,MJ Santner,caught,WP Saha,32,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-196,"91.1 gets him first ball after lunch! Seems harsh to call it a mistake, but Santner was never going to reach the pitch of this good length ball so him going forward and prodding at it was a low-percentage shot. Made worse by the turn off the pitch. Kisses the outside edge and Saha takes an outstanding catch, staying low and moving to his left 255/6",,Keeper,Ashwin
37,197,BJ Watling,caught,R Ashwin,21,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-197,"95.5 caught and bowled! Kanpur roars. Four wickets in 10 balls for India's super spinners. Slowed it down beautifully. Watling was coming down the pitch, and yet the ball dipped on him. The cover drive took the inside edge and popped back to the bowler. Ashwin dives to his right and takes it well 262/10",,Return catch,Ashwin
37,198,MJ Guptill,caught,M Vijay,0,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-198,"3.1 goes to sweep, but I think an inside edge has lobbed off his pads to silly point. Umpire Kettleborough takes his time to decide, and makes a superb call as the replays indicate. Guptill had seen wide open spaces deep on the leg side and looked to target them. But he didn't quite have the room as Ashwin tossed this delivery up around the fifth stump. And he was a little too close to the ball to pull off a shot that needs room 2/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
37,199,TWM Latham,lbw,,2,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-199,"3.5 beautiful bowling! He spoke about how he had seen NZ left-handers plonking their front foot straight down the pitch. And Latham's front leg - on middle and off - is put under siege. Hit in line with off stump, would take out middle. Great skill from Ashwin. Looked like the off break that didn't turn. Latham was playing for the ball to pitch on a good length and veer away. 3/2",,,Ashwin
37,200,KS Williamson,lbw,,25,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-200,"17.5 does him in! That's Ashwin's 200th, second fastest in Test history. It's quick. It turns. It strikes Williamson on the move as he goes back and in line with off stump. The NZ captain was attempting a flick, but the deviation off the pitch is too quick for him. 43/3",Yes,,Ashwin
37,201,MJ Santner,caught,RG Sharma,71,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-201,"79.2 unplayable! Honestly. It pitched more than a set of stumps outside leg. Then it leaps up at the batsman like a scary little terrier. Santner was squared up by the turn, surprised by the bounce. The outside edge from the shoulder of the bat is safely pouched at silly point. Santner stood where he was and smiled in bemused fashion, wondering if physics should have allowed such a thing to happen. 223/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
37,202,IS Sodhi,bowled,,17,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-202,"83.3 moved too far across to play a flick and a ball he flicks out of the front of his hand, and yet the seam is bolt upright pointing to slip, pitches on leg stump, straightens and topples it! Sticks his tongue out and wags his forefinger at the batsman, not unlike a cheeky professor telling his students off. He likes the new ball. He hates the old one because it goes soft and doesn't turn as quickly. That's Ashwin's 19th five-for in only 37Tests 236/9",,,Ashwin
37,203,N Wagner,lbw,,0,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,22-Sep-16,Test # 2221,ashwin-wkt-203,"87.3 pins him in front and Ashwin wraps up the 500th Test for India with his fifth ten-wicket haul as well. Sneaks in the carrom ball, pitches it on off stump, veers it into the left-hander. Wagner had no clue about the variation. He was playing for off stump and was a dead duck 236/10",,,Ashwin
38,204,JS Patel,caught,Mohammed Shami,47,2,v New Zealand,Eden Gardens,India,30-Sep-16,Test # 2222,ashwin-wkt-204,"47.1 and he strikes immediately. Tossed up nice and slow outside off. Patel aims for cow corner, and ends up skying a catch to mid-off moving to his right. I think the drift undid him here. It drifted away, pitched, and didn't turn, just went on with the drift 182/8",,InField,Ashwin
38,205,MJ Guptill,lbw,,24,4,v New Zealand,Eden Gardens,India,30-Sep-16,Test # 2222,ashwin-wkt-205,"16.5 gone! Again that dip, again it turns in from outside off, but this time it pitched fuller, and hit his front pad juust about in line with off stump when he came forward to defend. Umpire Kettleborough thought about it for a couple of seconds and then raised his finger. Guptill's front leg was just about a foot outside the crease. His back leg was a long way inside the crease. Strange position to defend from 55/1",,,Ashwin
38,206,LRPL Taylor,lbw,,4,4,v New Zealand,Eden Gardens,India,30-Sep-16,Test # 2222,ashwin-wkt-206,"42.6 drift, beautiful drift, and Ross Taylor plays down the wrong line. His bat goes from gully towards wide mid-on, as it often does, and the ball drifts away, turns in just a little, and beats his outside edge to hit his front pad. Richard Kettleborough didn't hesitate to give that out, and I suspect it was plumb, hitting in front of middle and off or thereabouts. In front of off stump 115/3",,,Ashwin
38,207,TWM Latham,caught,WP Saha,74,4,v New Zealand,Eden Gardens,India,30-Sep-16,Test # 2222,ashwin-wkt-207,"53.3 got him, and that's a beauty of a delivery. Floated it up high and inviting, wide of off. Drives away from his body and nicks to Saha. Didn't get to the pitch of it at all 141/4",,Keeper,Ashwin
39,208,TWM Latham,caught,R Ashwin,53,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-208,"34.2 teasing little offbreak. Worse, it had masqueraded as a half-volley on the pads. Poor Latham thought he had a single for the taking, bringing his bat across his front pad and playing with a closed face. But the ball - a lot slower in pace, that was the key to the wicket - lobs up off the leading edge and Ashwin takes an absolute dolly of a catch 118/1",,Return catch,Ashwin
39,209,KS Williamson,bowled,,8,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-209,"42.6 dragged on! He's played Ashwin's good-length balls off the back foot, not entirely a terrible ploy, but the problem arose when he went for the cut. A straight bat could have saved him, but the horizontal one simply made him feel more cramped and it presents the ball with the perfect opportunity to take the inside edge and trickle onto the stumps. Rare mistake from Williamson. 134/2",,,Ashwin
39,210,LRPL Taylor,caught,AM Rahane,0,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-210,"44.5 it's the straight one! Oh, wait. It turned just a tiny bit. Taylor was just playing too far inside the line. And he has this technique as well where he doesn't push too far forward and the bat comes down at an angle from gully. Ashwin, by pulling his length back, gets the outside edge and Rahane mops things up 140/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
39,211,L Ronchi,caught,AM Rahane,0,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-211,"48.1 off the thigh of the keeper to the first slip. Superb work from Rahane, diving to his right. Outstanding reflexes. The delivery wasn't too bad either. Drifted away from Ronchi, who had come forward expecting top block a good length ball and suddenly finding that he was playing inside the line. Fine edge, hitchhikes its way to India's vice-captain 148/5",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
39,212,JDS Neesham,lbw,,71,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-212,"86.2 hasn't it straightened too much? Umpire Dharmasena thinks not and raises the finger and Ashwin has his 20th five-wicket haul. He wrapped it up with a well flighted delivery that Neesham played all around with a sweep. Struck on the back thigh, but that back thigh was probably outside the line of off stump. Neesham went back to the dressing room, waited by the monitor to see the replay and then strode off disgusted 276/8",,,Ashwin
39,213,TA Boult,caught,CA Pujara,0,2,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-213,"90.2 Ashwin has six! shimmes down, looks to heave it towards midwicket, gets a top edge and Pujara takes the catch. A superb one at that, because the ball went so high. Backtracked from midwicket and pulled it off serenely 299/10",,InField,Ashwin
39,214,KS Williamson,lbw,,27,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-214,"10.6 big appeal for lbw, Williamson opened himself up for that by going deep in his crease and looks woeful when umpire Oxenford gives him out. It looked dicey. It was a tough decision, mostly in terms of adjudicating how much the ball was spinning. It ripped off a good length from outside off to pin Williamson in front of middle, and with him being so far back, there was not much distance to travel. All in all, a top decision 42/2",,,Ashwin
39,215,LRPL Taylor,bowled,,32,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-215,"18.3 sweeps the wrong ball, and Ashwin waves bye-bye to him. It's slower through the air. It's too full for the shot. He should be driving at those, but hitting across the line like that, he's sabotaged himself 80/3",,,Ashwin
39,216,L Ronchi,bowled,,15,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-216,"22.4 fooled him! And then messes up his stumps for good measure. It was pretty full delivery, but Ronchi was suckered into playing back because the trajectory was flat. Then just to make the batsman feel like the world is against him, it stays low too. 102/4",,,Ashwin
39,217,MJ Santner,bowled,,14,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-217,"32.5 goes straight on, and poor Santner throws a 'how do you do that?' and then an 'is there no mercy in the world?' stare at the celebrating Ashwin. It's the proper offspinner, not even the undercutter. So the batsman was well within his right to expect it to turn. And it does, just not that much. Takes the inside edge, then the pad and onto the stumps. That's 10 in the Test for Ashwin, his 6th time doing so 136/7",,,Ashwin
39,218,JS Patel,bowled,,0,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-218,"34.1 now he's got a five-for in each innings! That was all a bit too easy. Tossed it up. Patel plays right across the line, trying a sweep while standing up. In effect, he ushered the ball onto his stumps 138/8",,,Ashwin
39,219,MJ Henry,caught,Mohammed Shami,0,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-219,"34.4 doesn't cost India much! Tossed up well wide of off stump, Henry goes for a slap over mid-off, but the ball dips. Henry can't reach the pitch and he mistimes the ball straight to mid-off instead 138/9",,InField,Ashwin
39,220,TA Boult,caught,R Ashwin,4,4,v New Zealand,Indore,India,08-Oct-16,Test # 2223,ashwin-wkt-220,"44.5 finishes it off, all by himself! Ashwin has a seventh - his best bowling in an innings, and in a Test match. Looped up to get him out of his crease and look for the drive. The ball dips on him though and it pops back. Watling throws his head down in disappointment. Coach Kumble is catching it all on camera, while the Indian dressing room explodes around him 153/10",,Return catch,Ashwin
40,221,H Hameed,lbw,,31,1,v England,Rajkot,India,09-Nov-16,Test # 2232,ashwin-wkt-221,"26.3 given, and that's a beauty from Ashwin! He's used this angle so brilliantly over these last three balls, and Hameed, with the intention of getthis his front pad out of the way while defending, is hit on the back pad as this drifts a little and goes with the angle to beat his outside edge. Hits him in line, and ball-tracking says it'll hit off stump too, after Hameed reviews it. That just looked out, and England have reviewed when they shouldn't have, after not reviewing when they should have. Hameed's technique, which looked so good so far, exposed a little here - his bat came down curtain rail style, a la KP or Ross Taylor, across the ball rather than down the line of it. Couple that with his front pad moving away from the line of the ball, and he's ended up opening himself up. 76/2",,,Ashwin
40,222,BM Duckett,caught,AM Rahane,13,1,v England,Rajkot,India,09-Nov-16,Test # 2232,ashwin-wkt-222,"32.3 gone! Rahane dives low to his right to take it at slip. Again it's tossed up slightly slower than the pace he's been bowling to Duckett so far, and his front foot is planted too early, moving away from the line of the ball again, and this time the ball turns to find his outside edge as he tries to defend. They go upstairs for the catch - Dharmasena's soft signal is out - and Rahane has scooped it up an inch from the ground. That's a superb catch. 102/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
40,223,AN Cook,caught,RA Jadeja,130,3,v England,Rajkot,India,09-Nov-16,Test # 2232,ashwin-wkt-223,"75.3 there it is, Cook holes out to long-off and England declare. Ashwin finally pockets a wicket and the players all walk off, Cook was trying to be enterprising and stepped out to hit down the ground, didn't get enough on it and Jadeja pouched a safe catch 260/3",,Outfield,Ashwin
41,224,BM Duckett,bowled,,5,2,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-224,"27.3 cleaned up this time! And in what is already familiar style. It seemed only a matter of time. Duckett standing on leg stump, leaving his stumps exposed, and Ashwin does him like a kipper. Drifted into middle and leg, then gripped enough to turn past the outside edge and into middle stump - which just shows what line Duckett was playing. The Bakerloo, while the ball went down the Piccadilly 72/3",,,Ashwin
41,225,JE Root,caught,UT Yadav,53,2,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-225,"31.5 oh my goodness! He's picked out long-off...who says he shouldn't be there. That's a horrid moment for Root. Came down the pitch, didn't quite get to the pitch, but went through with the shot and he miscues it to long-off. He was keen to not let Ashwin settle, but England were already in trouble. A rare misjudgement of the moment from Root 79/4",,Outfield,Ashwin
41,226,BA Stokes,lbw,,70,2,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-226,"90.4 and he's gone! Ashwin strikes. But Stokes has called for the review. He's been given lbw, but it was also caught at silly point. So he could be out either way. Third umpire taking a lot time in deciding if there's bat involved. The bat clips the pad as well. Third umpire says it's not conclusive for bat, but it's three reds for lbw so it won't matter. He's lbw. The ball slid on from round the wicket, squeezed past the inside edge and was very adjacent 225/7",,,Ashwin
41,227,SCJ Broad,lbw,,13,2,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-227,"102.4 Dharmasena has taken at eternity to give this, and Broad doesn't have a review he can use. This looks leg side to me. This is short of a length, doesn't turn, beats Broad's inside edge because it doesn't turn, and has hit him in front of leg, I think. Definitely worth a review, but the two men before Broad have wasted the reviews 255/9",,,Ashwin
41,228,JM Anderson,lbw,,0,2,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-228,"102.5 Ashwin has got Anderson first ball. He'll be on hat-trick in the second innings. Ashwin has another five-for. India have an option to enforce the follow-on, but they won't do it. Anderson goes back to defend a length ball, but it doesn't turn and catches him on the back foot and dead plumb 255/10",,,Ashwin
41,229,H Hameed,lbw,,25,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-229,"50.2 a shooter gets Ashwin the wicket. This is like Hooper getting Hussain. Hameed is lbw too. Can't do anything about these. Offbrreak, on a length, outside off, and it just doesn't leave the ground. Squeezes under the toe and strikes him flush in front. If it hadn't hit the pad, it would have bounced twice. Habeeb has seen off 144 balls nonetheless. Well played 75/1",,,Ashwin
41,230,BM Duckett,caught,WP Saha,0,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-230,"64.5 and he's gone! Duckett's problems continue. He went for the aggressive option, another sweep, there was a touch of extra bounce from the over-spin, it takes the glove into the thigh pad and loops up to offer Saha a simple catch 92/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
41,231,ZS Ansari,bowled,,0,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,17-Nov-16,Test # 2235,ashwin-wkt-231,"94.3 cleaned up! Simple as that, really. A touch flatter and quicker, then it gripped. Ansari playing back, spins from outside leg and hammers middle. Kept a bit low, too. Tough. 143/8",,,Ashwin
42,232,AN Cook,caught,PA Patel,27,1,v England,Mohali,India,26-Nov-16,Test # 2238,ashwin-wkt-232,15.1 who writes their scripts? India have turned it around. And Ashwin it is. He dropped a sitter 10 minutes ago. And this is not a wicket-taking ball either. This is short and wide. The cut is on. Just that Cook doesn't play it well. Gets a thin edge into Patel's gloves. England have let India back into the game. And now India feel it 51/3,,Keeper,Ashwin
42,233,AN Cook,bowled,,12,3,v England,Mohali,India,26-Nov-16,Test # 2238,ashwin-wkt-233,13.6 through the gate and smashing the stumps! Simply played the wrong line as Cook played for turn but left a gaping hole between bat and pad. Probing line from Ashwin but the seed of doubt caused by a nibble of turn was enough to unsettle England's master player of spin 27/1,,,Ashwin
42,234,MM Ali,caught,J Yadav,5,3,v England,Mohali,India,26-Nov-16,Test # 2238,ashwin-wkt-234,"19.5 chipped in the air, such a nothing shot, and he is pouched with ease at mid-on! Came down the track, expecting the half-volley, but was bamboozled in flight, tried to check his stroke, and gave his innings away once again! 39/2",,InField,Ashwin
42,235,BA Stokes,lbw,,5,3,v England,Mohali,India,26-Nov-16,Test # 2238,ashwin-wkt-235,"37.1 big appeal first ball as he squares him up. And Kohli has reviewed this. Given not-out on the field. India have pulled one out of the hat. The review has worked, and the big wicket of Stokes is in the bag. This is pitched middle and off, Stokes is squared up by the turn, and is hit in front of off. The projection shows hitting the top of off 78/4",,,Ashwin
43,236,JE Root,caught,V Kohli,21,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-236,"38.2 super catch! Kohli at slip. Touch wider outside off, lures Root into the drive. Kohli was moving the wrong way (to his right) but managed to adjust and grab the catch low to his left. Outstanding reflexes from the skipper. 136/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
43,237,MM Ali,caught,KK Nair,50,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-237,70.2 and he's broken through! That man Ashwin again! Moeen has been keen to attack since tea. Goes for another sweep. Gets a big top edge this time which goes straight up in the air and lands in the hands of midwicket 230/3,,InField,Ashwin
43,238,KK Jennings,caught,CA Pujara,112,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-238,"70.4 that's brilliant! Edged to a very deep gully who had just been brought in. Good length at off stump, drew him forward, a thick edge is taken very smartly, low by Pujara. Excellent bowling, smart captaincy. The game changes 230/4",,Close-in,Ashwin
43,239,JM Bairstow,caught,UT Yadav,14,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-239,"80.2 a top edge and taken at deep backward square leg. Bairstow is distraught. This pitch has shown extra bounce through the day. So that shot was always going to be fraught with risk. Pushed through on middle and leg, Bairstow gets low and looks to sweep hard. Doesn't account for some extra bounce, it takes the top edge and flies to backward square leg who runs in a few metres and takes a good catch in front of his midriff. India storming back 249/5",,Outfield,Ashwin
43,240,BA Stokes,caught,V Kohli,31,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-240,"96.6 they are all up for an edge to slip! Given not out. Kohli reviews. More sharp turn. Like a little like his dismissal in Mohali. Yes, there's an edge here by the looks of it. Then it clips the keeper on the way to slip. Although the bat also hits the ground, could that be what makes the sound? But third umpire happy it's conclusive evidence a nick. Stokes isn't happy. He felt the bat hitting the ground 297/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
43,241,JT Ball,caught,PA Patel,31,1,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-241,"127.2 he's gone now! Can head off for some more treatment. Excellent catch by Parthiv. Sharp spin and bounce from outside off, cramps Ball for room and takes a top edge as he tries to play to the off side 388/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
43,242,BA Stokes,caught,M Vijay,18,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-242,"43.3 given again by umpire Oxenford. Stokes has a chat with the umpire and decides to walk off. The umpires just want to check if it has carried though? Or has it gone straight off the boot? Soft signal is out. Yes, lobbed off the boot. Flat delivery from Ashwin on off, Stokes gets low and reverse-sweeps onto his front shoe (off the inside edge), the ball pops up and carries low to Vijay at second slip, who came in and took the catch. Excellent decision. 180/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
43,243,JT Ball,caught,PA Patel,2,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-243,"47.3 another one, just before stumps. Yes, he has edged it. He's done his job though. Lots of flight on that on off, the topspinner. Ball gets forward and plays for some turn, but Ashwin ensured there wasn't much spin because of the variation. Ball gets a thin outside edge which is well held by Parthiv. India strike off the last ball of the day. 182/6",,Keeper,Ashwin
43,244,JM Bairstow,lbw,,51,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-244,"49.6 done him this! It's a carrom ball. Bairstow reviews straightaway. Did it turn too much? Magnificent bowling, regardless. Squared up Bairstow on the back foot. Will it miss off stump? Nope! It's smashing off stump. That's a wonderful piece of deception and skill. 185/7",,,Ashwin
43,245,CR Woakes,bowled,,0,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-245,"51.5 cleaned him up! There's no stopping Ashwin. This is a classical offspinner's dismissal. Tossed up outside off, lures Woakes into the drive and it spins through the gate. Poor shot, given the risk and reward 189/8",,,Ashwin
43,246,AU Rashid,caught,KL Rahul,2,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-246,53.4 another five-wicket haul for him! England falling in a heap. Rashid just flicks in the air and places it down the throat of deep midwicket. Horrid shot 193/9,,Outfield,Ashwin
43,247,JM Anderson,caught,UT Yadav,2,3,v England,Wankhede,India,08-Dec-16,Test # 2239,ashwin-wkt-247,"55.3 and there it is! Ashwin takes the last, his sixth of the innings and 12th of the match. Anderson just flicks in the air to the leg side, was another carrom ball, and finds mid-on 195/10",,InField,Ashwin
44,248,BA Stokes,caught,PA Patel,6,1,v England,Chennai,India,16-Dec-16,Test # 2241,ashwin-wkt-248,"90.5 got 'im! The method was clear. He wanted the left-handers reaching forward. He knows there is turn in this pitch. All he had to do was slow it up to make Stokes reaches out thrusting at the ball Then the dip does him. Forward defence, but the batsman had no hope of reaching the pitch of the ball, and a faint edge goes through to the keeper. Nice catch from Parthiv too. 287/5",,Keeper,Ashwin
45,249,Shakib Al Hasan,caught,UT Yadav,82,2,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-249,"62.1 this has been happening way too often with Shakib. He gets set. He looks to dominate, then he plays a poor shot. A low percentage shot. Comes down the track, doesn't reach the pitch, still goes for the loft, against the turn, mis-hits to mid-on. The exactly way he fell on a crucial final day's play in New Zealand when they were desperately trying to survive and hold on for a draw. And Ashwin has his wicket, doing very little other than being persistent and waiting for the batsman to make the mistake 216/5",,InField,Ashwin
45,250,Mushfiqur Rahim,caught,WP Saha,127,2,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-250,"127.5 and gone! Caught down the leg side. Flat delivery, a carrom ball down leg, Rahim looks to sweep but gets a bit of glove on that. Saha takes a fantastic catch and Ashwin gets to 250 Test wickets, he's the fastest to the landmark. End of a superb innings from Rahim, carried Bangladesh to a decent total against a strong attack. That will be lunch too. 388/10",Yes,Keeper,Ashwin
45,251,Tamim Iqbal,caught,V Kohli,3,4,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-251,"5.2 big big appeal. No, says umpire Joel Wilson. Was it caught? Kohli had taken that. Kohli reviews. Flat on off and middle, Tamin gets right forward and inside-edges the ball into his front pad. The ball then lobs up towards Kohli at gully, who takes the ball and appeals. The umpire will have to overturn his decision. Some have been turning, some haven't in this innings already. That one didn't. Kohli was particularly adamant that the batsman had hit that, asked Saha for confirmation and went for the review. Good assertive captaincy. 11/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
45,252,Mominul Haque,caught,AM Rahane,27,4,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-252,"24.1 and strikes immediately! Mominul doesn't really get in much of a front-foot stride, and that is a good thing sometimes when you're guarding against lbw on a slow pitch. But Ashwin isn't aiming for lbw here. He floats it up on leg stump, and Mominul's short stride finds him a long way from the pitch of a ball that turns sharply, and his attempt at a defensive push results in an outside edge and another catch for Rahane at slip 75/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
45,253,Mushfiqur Rahim,caught,RA Jadeja,23,4,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-253,"52.4 that's one shot too much. Ashwin has sensed that the batsman wants to attack him, so he pulls the length back just enough. Disguises it though, by ensuring it is still a tossed up delivery. Mushfiqur rushes down the track, doesn't get to the pitch, still backs himself to clear mid-off, but mistimes his shot badly. Easy catch to the fielder running back and Ashwin celebrates by waving both his hands in the air to soak in the applause from the school kids 162/5",,InField,Ashwin
45,254,Taskin Ahmed,lbw,,1,4,v Bangladesh,Hyderabad,India,09-Feb-17,Test # 2249,ashwin-wkt-254,"100.3 tosses it up, massively, and Taskin tries to flick, seems to miss the ball and opens himself up for an lbw appeal. Umpire Erasmus says wait, and then goes to check with his partner. Finally, he tags in the third umpire, and the soft signal is out. No bat there, so the catch should go out the window. They don't check the lbw though, not out flashes on the screen. But wait, Kohli has reviewed for lbw. So two reviews for the same ball. Pitched in line with leg, straightens enough to hit the front pad in line, and crashes into the stumps too. Three reds. India win 250/10",,,Ashwin
46,255,SPD Smith,caught,V Kohli,27,1,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-255,"60.1 straight to midwicket! After all the hardwork, Smith chips his wicket away. A flat delivery outside off from Ashwin, Smith runs down to the pitch and flicks nicely but can't keep it down or find the gap. Hits it at a comfortable height to Kohli at a square midwicket, who is typically delighted. That's a big wicket. Australia lose two in succession. 149/4",,InField,Ashwin
46,256,MT Renshaw,caught,M Vijay,68,1,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-256,"78.3 edged and taken. Beautifully bowled that. Went over the wicket, chose a round-arm action. The ball pitches straight and so Renshaw thinks he has to play. But he doesn't really. He chases after the ball and edges the ball to second slip, where Vijay gets forward and takes a good catch. Undone by some superb bowling. But that was a really good knock. 196/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
46,257,MA Starc,caught,RA Jadeja,61,1,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-257,"94.5 slog sweeeeep... but he picks out the man at deep midwicket. That's the Australian innings done, Ashwin enjoys the scalp, clapping as he watches Starc walk off. The ball was tossed up again, making the batsman think he should go for the big swipe. But it's a lot closer to middle and leg, not allowing him the leverage he wants. Simple catch at cow corner 260/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
46,258,DA Warner,lbw,,10,3,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-258,"0.6 plays the wrong line and he's been given lbw. Short and sweet from the Bull. Not sure how he could have reacted to this ball, knowing this pitch is turning big. It's the orthodox offbreak, pitching on off stump, so Warner defends outside it. Only the ball goes on with the arm and pins him in front of middle 10/1",,,Ashwin
46,259,SE Marsh,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-259,"6.6 that's gone. It's the straight one. It's always the straight one. Marsh comes forward to block, but he is doing so expecting turn. And by the time he is aware of the natural variation, he is pinned on the pad in front of middle 23/2",,,Ashwin
46,260,PSP Handscomb,caught,M Vijay,19,3,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-260,"20.6 taken at leg gully. From having the ball covered one second to losing your wicket the next, this is the danger for a batsman on this pitch. Handscomb read the length as short and shifted deep in his crease to try and flick the ball through square leg, but the extra bounce does him in. 61/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
46,261,MA Starc,caught,KL Rahul,30,3,v Australia,Pune,India,23-Feb-17,Test # 2250,ashwin-wkt-261,"77.6 he's holed out. Another fantastic contribution from Starc. Ashwin tosses it up nicely, Starc isn't too perturbed by the fear of failure if he mis-times the ball. Gets low and swipes a ball to deep midwicket. KL Rahul came in and took a good running catch, made a simple catch look simple. 258/8",,Outfield,Ashwin
47,262,DA Warner,bowled,,33,2,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-262,"21.1 Ashwin has struck. That rough outside leg has worked. Ashwin is pumped up. Warner is caught in two minds to this one pitched well outside leg but turning towards the stumps. Warner shapes up to pad up, but sees the extravagant turn and tries to chase the ball with his hands. The ball spins past the bat and hits the off stump. The crowd has found its voice. It will sound strange to those who don't know cricket but had Warner committed to not committing to this delivery, he could have padded it away easily 52/1",,,Ashwin
47,263,MA Starc,caught,RA Jadeja,26,2,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-263,"117.6 Jadeja missed one chance yesterday when he didn't pick the ball at extra cover, but he has pulled off a beauty here. Starc slog-sweeps against the turn, Jadeja is at deep midwicket but not all the way back. So he has to judge it, run back, and take it overhead. They look easy on TV but when you have a 360-degree view for these, the way you judge the catch is key, and this is superbly judged 269/7",,Outfield,Ashwin
47,264,DA Warner,lbw,,17,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-264,"9.1 lbw first ball. Long long chat, and they decide to review. Warner doesn't look convinced, but he has reviewed it. Warner has picked a ball too full to sweep and is beaten. The question is, has he got an edge or has it straightened enough? This is pitched outside off, the ball has straightened, and I don't see any part of ball in line. However, the machine is showing ""umpire's call"". I don't know how. I must be wrong, but I will need an explanation from somebody here. Don't see any part of ball in line. They show umpire's call. Both on impact and the stumps. On many more replays, perhaps one mm of the ball hit him in line. Oof 42/2",,,Ashwin
47,265,MR Marsh,caught,KK Nair,13,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-265,"25.6 this is how Lyon took all those wickets in the first innings. Marsh goes back to a length ball, the ball kicks and jumps, he follows it with his hands and gloves it onto his thigh pad. Nair at short leg is so exited he starts celebrating before taking the catch. His hands flick his helmet as they go up to complete the catch, but the ball is a long way from the helmet 101/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
47,266,MS Wade,caught,WP Saha,0,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-266,"27.5 And Jadeja and Ashwin have produced another wicket before tea. Saha takes a great catch too. An offbreak on off. Wade plays for the turn. The ball doesn't turn, hits the inside edge onto the pad and lobs towards the vacant short leg. Saha dives full length. Nay he flies. Takes it with both hands 101/6",,Keeper,Ashwin
47,267,MA Starc,bowled,,1,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-267,"29.4 full ball, no turn, and India are three strikes away. Natural variation again. Starc defends for the turn, but there is no turn on this offbreak, and he has had his off stump pegged back. Off the underarm too. India ecstatic. The jack in the box gone. Credit to Ashwin, watching the replay. This is the topspinner with the seam upright 103/7",,,Ashwin
47,268,PSP Handscomb,caught,WP Saha,24,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-268,"35.2 that's a 25th five-for for Ashwin. Is this another topspinner? No it is a regulation offbreak. Handscomb tries something desperate with only tail for company. Jumps out of the crease, doesn't get to the pitch of it, and hence tries a slog. The ball, though, explodes from the pitch and stands up to take a massive edge for Saha to claim running a few metres back 110/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
47,269,NM Lyon,caught,R Ashwin,2,4,v Australia,Bengaluru,India,04-Mar-17,Test # 2251,ashwin-wkt-269,"35.4 Ashwin ends it with a return catch and throws the ball to the moon. Classic offspinners' dismissal to get the rival offspinner out. Tosses this up outside off, draws a drive, beats him in flight and accepts the catch himself 112/10",,Return catch,Ashwin
48,270,SE Marsh,caught,CA Pujara,2,1,v Australia,Ranchi,India,16-Mar-17,Test # 2256,ashwin-wkt-270,"25.1 big big shout for bat-pad, not given and India have reviewed it immediately. Good drift on this, making Marsh play around his front pad. The ball pitches middle and leg, the drift making him play not under his eye. The ball turns but only a touch, and straightens to take the inside edge. It flies off the bad, and Pujara dives to his left to take a sharp catch. Really good offspin bowling, really good catch, and a really good review 89/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
48,271,GJ Maxwell,caught,M Vijay,2,3,v Australia,Ranchi,India,16-Mar-17,Test # 2256,ashwin-wkt-271,"94.4 and India have got Maxwell. He quietly walks off. The carrom ball gets him. Again it's not because he hasn't picked it, but because it hasn't turned as much as expected. Maxwell bat-pads it to silly point 190/6",,Close-in,Ashwin
49,272,SPD Smith,caught,AM Rahane,111,1,v Australia,Dharamsala,India,25-Mar-17,Test # 2258,ashwin-wkt-272,"59.5 Smith is gone. Huge wicket. Rahane takes a lovely low catch at slip. Smith plays for an offbreak. This is a length ball, around off. Smith is back, looks to cover the turn, but the ball doesn't turn, and takes a sharp outside edge. Rahane catches this low to his left. Second big catch from Rahane this session 208/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
49,273,PSP Handscomb,caught,AM Rahane,18,3,v Australia,Dharamsala,India,25-Mar-17,Test # 2258,ashwin-wkt-273,"24.3 that's another beauty from Rahane. Smith and Rahane are outdoing each other at slip. This is a length ball, outside off, hits the bare patch and refuses to turn. What it also does is takex extra bounce, and flies off the edge. Rahane is falling behind, adjusting for this quick offering, and takes it two handed. Great reflexes, great hands 87/4",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
49,274,GJ Maxwell,lbw,,45,3,v Australia,Dharamsala,India,25-Mar-17,Test # 2258,ashwin-wkt-274,"32.3 brain fade from Maxwell? He has padded up to one outside off. No shot offered, the umpire confirms. Maxwell reviews the out decision. He has padded up to a fullish offbreak outside off. This is a massive break in concentration. This is a big offbreak, looks like it could even miss leg, but desperately for Maxwell it returns an umpire's call on the leg stump. One centimetre of the ball hitting the leg stump there. The on-field call stays 106/6",,,Ashwin
49,275,JR Hazlewood,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Dharamsala,India,25-Mar-17,Test # 2258,ashwin-wkt-275,"53.5 another appeal, given again, and Hazlewood has reviewed this one. Will this innings resume again? Seems like this has been given out caught at silly point. No edge, though. This has hit him on the knee roll in front of off. They check the lbw too. This has returned umpire's call for height on middle stump. The on-field decision remains, which means the umpire must have given him out lbw on the field 137/10",,,Ashwin
50,276,N Dickwella,caught,A Mukund,8,2,v Sri Lanka,Galle,Sri Lanka,26-Jul-17,Test # 2265,ashwin-wkt-276,"39.2 You can't get away from Abhinav! He pulls off a one-hander at silly-point. Outstanding reflexes. This was an outstanding ball as well. Dip, turn and bounce - the perfect cocktail. Pitches on middle and breaks away, Dickwella presses forward, but the ball dips, creating distance between the bat and pitch. He jabs at it with hard hands. Abhinav throws himself to his right and snaffles the outside edge with one hand even as the ball was dipping. He plucks it inches from the ground 143/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
50,277,N Dickwella,caught,WP Saha,67,4,v Sri Lanka,Galle,Sri Lanka,26-Jul-17,Test # 2265,ashwin-wkt-277,"61.5 Dickwella has been given out caught behind. He walks off, giving Ashwin his first wicket of the innings. This was well bowled. Tossed up higher and wider outside off from around the wicket. Ashwin gets the ball to turn and bounce. Dickwella dares to sweep against the break. The extra bounce catches the top edge, a thin one, and Saha pouches it. End of a hit-and-miss innings 217/5",,Keeper,Ashwin
50,278,FDM Karunaratne,bowled,,97,4,v Sri Lanka,Galle,Sri Lanka,26-Jul-17,Test # 2265,ashwin-wkt-278,"73.2 No hundred for Dimuth! He drags a sweep back onto the middle stump. This was pushed through full and drifts outside off, Dimuth loses his patience and subsequently his wicket. A thick bottom edge disturbs the stumps 240/6",,,Ashwin
50,279,N Pradeep,caught,V Kohli,0,4,v Sri Lanka,Galle,Sri Lanka,26-Jul-17,Test # 2265,ashwin-wkt-279,"73.4 Kohli dives forward and takes it at leg slip Tossed-up offbreak, lifting at Nuwan Pradeep, who prods at it. The ball brushes the glove and loops to the Indian captain. Kohli isn't the best close-in fielder, but he clings onto this chance 240/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
51,280,WU Tharanga,caught,KL Rahul,0,2,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-280,"1.6 how has he taken that? Rahul at short leg. The dab comes out. Quick on the pads, Ashwin's worst ball. Whipped straight into Rahul's midriff at short leg. Once it's there, Rahul knows he has to hang on to it, so he gets his hands up and clings on. Unlucky, but don't hit it uppishly to a fielder 0/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
51,281,FDM Karunaratne,caught,AM Rahane,25,2,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-281,"13.4 Ashwin finds the outside edge again, Rahane at first slip bends low and snaffles this chance. Full, drifts in from around the wicket, and turns away just enough to graze the edge. Karunaratne did not help himself by prodding with an angled bat with a very short stride 33/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
51,282,AD Mathews,caught,CA Pujara,26,2,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-282,"33.6 that is simply not possible and yet Pujara comes up with the ball in his hand! What a catch at leg gully, off a full blooded flick behind square leg! We can savour the moment as the umpires check on the legality of the catch. Ashwin gets a little bounce on the offbreak, and Mathews tries to ride it, and he might well have because the ball is going down to Pujara's left. But he moves smartly, gets his hand under the ball and takes it superbly 117/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
51,283,MDK Perera,bowled,,25,2,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-283,"47.2 bowled'em. India wrap up Sri Lanka for 171. Oh wait, India are hanging around to see if Pradeep will bat. And he walks in with an injured hamstring. Poor fella. Out goes Perera. This was tossed up delightfully outside off, spins in, floats through the gate to hit the stumps. Perera was drawn forward to drive against the break 171/9",,,Ashwin
51,284,N Pradeep,bowled,,0,2,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-284,"49.4 Poor Pradeep. He walks in with an injured hamstring and gets bowled for a duck. Ashwin caps the innings with another five-wicket haul. He hung this offbreak up outside off, turns in, Pradeep was attempting to let it go. The ball grazes the inside edge and rolls back onto the stumps 183/10",,,Ashwin
51,285,PM Pushpakumara,bowled,,16,3,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-285,"72.2 Oh Malinda, what was that? A coach will rip his hair out looking at this. He pre-meditates a reverse swat or rather a reverse slog. Malinda shapes for the fatal hit and shows his ace early, way before Ashwin delivered the ball. The bowler spotted it, fired it flatter and quicker and hit the leg stump. Why abandon the defence when it's your strength? Only Malinda knows why he did that. It looked very, very ugly, that reverse - one of the genuine contenders for the worst shot ever 238/3",,,Ashwin
51,286,N Pradeep,caught,S Dhawan,1,3,v Sri Lanka,Colombo (SSC),Sri Lanka,03-Aug-17,Test # 2267,ashwin-wkt-286,"116.5 It's all over at the SSC. Tossed up slower and higher outside off. Pradeep - busted hamstring and all - aims a biiiig slog-sweep. He only shoots up a top-edge in the air. Dhawan, who set up the series for India with a breakneck 190, fittingly sews up the series. He settles under this skier at mid-on and slaps the thigh 386/10",,InField,Ashwin
52,287,LD Chandimal,caught,KL Rahul,48,2,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-287,"31.3 worked straight into the hands of leg gully. Plenty of flight outside off from Ashwin, spins back in. Chandimal sees that flight and complacently tries to work that into the leg side, but the ball takes the inside half of the bat, ricochets into the pad and then to leg gully. A soft dismissal. 125/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
52,288,PADLR Sandakan,caught,S Dhawan,10,2,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-288,"37.4 and that's the end of the innings. Flat on middle and leg, Sandakan gets a thick inside edge into his pad and goes to leg gully. Another soft dismissal. 135/10",,Close-in,Ashwin
52,289,FDM Karunaratne,caught,AM Rahane,16,3,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-289,"15.3 and the wicket. Another terrific delivery. Flat and quick outside off, Karunaratne has no idea if it's the slider or the one that turns. His feet are nowhere and he fiddles at the ball, chases after the turn and gets some glove/shoulder of the bat on it. Easily snaffled up by slip. He could have played that better, just played the line, but that's easier to say than play. A deserved wicket for Ashwin, did him in with that previous delivery too. The pace was good too, he didn't let Karunaratne come forward or go back decisively 26/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
52,290,AD Mathews,lbw,,35,3,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-290,"53.6 an appeal for leg-before. Umpire Illingworth raises his finger. Mathews chooses to challenge the on-field out decision. Did he get bat onto it? Replays suggest that there's no bat involved. The impact is in line and the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. TV umpire Oxenford upholds the on-field decision. Mathews dares to sweep from the stumps and does not make contact again. This was pushed through faster and fuller, he was pinned in front of middle 118/6",,,Ashwin
52,291,MDK Perera,caught,HH Pandya,8,3,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-291,"59.3 Dilruwan Perera finds deep midwicket, again. May have been the topspinner outside off, Dilruwan looks for the sweep but the ball gets some extra bounce and takes the leading edge. Pandya has some ground to cover to his right, but does it with time to spare. An awful match for Dilruwan may have ended 138/7",,Outfield,Ashwin
52,292,CBRLS Kumara,bowled,,10,3,v Sri Lanka,Pallekele,Sri Lanka,12-Aug-17,Test # 2269,ashwin-wkt-292,"74.3 and that's the innings! And match! And series! India complete a 3-0 series whitewash. The carrom ball outside off, started it wide enough, the ball beats Kumara on the outside edge and knocks into off stump. 181/10",,,Ashwin
54,293,HDRL Thirimanne,bowled,,9,1,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-293,"24.6 the pressure that Ashwin's so beautifully created has brought out a poor slog sweep. That's the first wicket for an India spinner in this series. Ashwin isn't generally this animated, but if ever someone deserved a wicket today, it's Ashwin. This was drifting in from around off, pitched and straightened to deflect off the back thigh onto the stumps, Thiri had to fetch this from a long way outside off. You could sense this was coming 44/2",,,Ashwin
54,294,MD Shanaka,bowled,,2,1,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-294,"65.2 that's a terrific delivery. Neither spinner has been getting too much spin, they have been getting drift though. Under-cut again, around middle. Shanaka is playing an offspinner so he tries to play for some turn, but the length is impeccable, allows the ball enough room to pitch and slide on to beat the outside edge, hits off stump. Gem of a delivery. The offbreak that took the inside edge in the previous over was the doubt-planter, setting him up for this. Excellent Test bowling. 165/6",,,Ashwin
54,295,LD Chandimal,lbw,,57,1,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-295,"71.3 87 kph, Kohli reviews. That looks close. Chandimal opts for the reverse sweep, or rather the switch hit. He is struck right in front of off and middle, but is it sliding on. I thought I saw a hint of turn, and that could make all the difference on HawkEye. No bat, three reds on HawkEye and Chandimal's resistance ends. Sri Lanka are withering away. Just wonder if he could have batted normally with Herath, and maybe looked for these strokes with the next man. All easy in hindsight. Good innings from Chandimal. Turned back just enough not to be missing his off stump 184/8",,,Ashwin
54,296,HMRKB Herath,caught,AM Rahane,4,1,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-296,"79.1 edged and taken at first slip. Lovely flight from Ashwin, drew Herath forward as a tentative poke flies low to Rahane, who anticipates the stroke and moves low to his right to complete the catch. That's wicket number 296 for Ashwin, his fourth of the innings. Sri Lanka bowled out for 205. 205/10",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
54,297,MD Shanaka,caught,KL Rahul,17,3,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-297,"33.3 puts everything into it, but it's only gone high, about the distance of an Everest or two, and under it is KL Rahul, who has run back from mid-on. Hitting out against a clever bowler needs a little bit more than ""okay, I'm going to charge at everything"". Ashwin lets this delivery hang in the air, a little wider of off stump. It's like the ball has secret buttons that only he can access. He flicks the one that says ""dip"" and it does, meaning Shanaka coming down the track still can't get to the pitch of it. Worse, he has to drag it. Goes full throttle. Then just goes. 102/6",,InField,Ashwin
54,298,MDK Perera,lbw,,0,3,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-298,"35.1 that's wicket number 298 and it's only confirmed by Sri Lanka's review. The chaos happens off a straight ball, which Ashwin has been bowling so often in this spell that it may well be intentional. Dilruwan, facing his first ball, is clearly flummoxed. He is playing for turn, the bat is inside the line and he's struck low on his front pad. ""Clearly no bat,"" says the third umpire. Ball-tracking gives an umpire's call. That's a third straight year that Ashwin has picked up 50 wickets 107/7",,,Ashwin
54,299,HMRKB Herath,caught,AM Rahane,0,3,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-299,"35.3 he keeps ticking it over, number 299! Unplayable. Gives it a proper rip. Makes it pitch on middle, from round the wicket, so Herath has to play. Comes forward, with lowish hands to defend, but the ball kicks up off the pitch, takes the top glove - that tells you how much bounce it gets - and lobs to Rahane at slip 107/8",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
54,300,PLS Gamage,bowled,,0,3,v Sri Lanka,Nagpur,India,24-Nov-17,Test # 2283,ashwin-wkt-300,"49.3 beats the outside edge and is it bowled? That's what is being reviewed because the bail has come off. And replays confirm that Ashwin has unleashed another carrom ball to become the fastest bowler in Test history to 300 Test wickets. This one perfectly pitched on leg stump, on a fuller length to draw the batsman forward, but not quite so much that he can get to the ball on the full. The angle in makes Gamage play inside the line. The turn ensures the rest. 166/10",Yes,,Ashwin
55,301,AD Mathews,caught,WP Saha,111,2,v Sri Lanka,Delhi,India,02-Dec-17,Test # 2286,ashwin-wkt-301,"97.6 there's the wicket, India's first for the day and the most threatening bowler who has bowled the least today has got Mathews with a pearl of a delivery. This was the quicker delivery that drifted away and skidded on, Mathews played for the turn when there was none, kissed the outside edge through to Saha who comes up with a fine take behind the stumps. India have broken the defiance just before tea. That should rejuvenate them. 256/4",,Keeper,Ashwin
55,302,ARS Silva,caught,S Dhawan,0,2,v Sri Lanka,Delhi,India,02-Dec-17,Test # 2286,ashwin-wkt-302,"117.4 and it's a forgettable debut. Thick inside edge off the pad to short leg. Jabbed at the delivery, the drift and revs on the ball did the trick for Ashwin. So, Roshen Silva has waited a long, long time to make his debut and has to walk back when his moment has arrived. All the elements of a typical Ashwin wicket. Overspin, drift, bounce. Superb to watch. 318/6",,Close-in,Ashwin
55,303,N Dickwella,bowled,,0,2,v Sri Lanka,Delhi,India,02-Dec-17,Test # 2286,ashwin-wkt-303,"119.2 got him. That's the end of Dickwella. Done in by an arm ball that cramps him for room, beat his cut and crash into the stumps. Played for the turn when there was none. Excellent from Ashwin. 322/7",,,Ashwin
55,304,LD Chandimal,bowled,,36,4,v Sri Lanka,Delhi,India,02-Dec-17,Test # 2286,ashwin-wkt-304,"54.6 going back to over the wicket has worked. This is a terrific delivery from Ashwin. Nice loop, tossed this up outside off, got this to dip on him as Chandimal is defeated in flight even as he steps out, still went to whip this through midwicket but this ball spun back in to sneak through the gap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. Superb planning. The century stand has been broken 147/5",,,Ashwin
56,305,K Rabada,caught,WP Saha,26,1,v South Africa,Cape Town,South Africa,05-Jan-18,Test # 2292,ashwin-wkt-305,"69.3 short, wide and caught behind! Rabada goes back, looking for the cut but fails to hit the ball cleanly. This is Cape Town, there is some extra bounce and the ball takes the top edge through to the keeper. Good take from the keeper 280/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
56,306,M Morkel,lbw,,2,1,v South Africa,Cape Town,South Africa,05-Jan-18,Test # 2292,ashwin-wkt-306,"73.1 plumb in front and that's the innings. Arm ball, seam pointing at leg stump, full and flat. He goes back, is beaten on the inside edge and trapped right in front of off stump 286/10",,,Ashwin
57,307,D Elgar,caught,M Vijay,31,1,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,13-Jan-18,Test # 2293,ashwin-wkt-307,"29.3 and he hangs on to a deflection off his stomach! A bizzare shot, but it was coming from Elgar. Ashwin was making him dance, really. He steps out, premeditatedly. It's back of a length from Ashwin so he's never going to reach the pitch of it. Forced to drive on the up. Hits it aerially into a jumping Vijay's mid-riff. It gets jammed there fractionally, between body and right elbow. He reacts quickly to juggle and hold on. That might have even carried to short extra if silly point wasn't there 85/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
57,308,AK Markram,caught,PA Patel,94,1,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,13-Jan-18,Test # 2293,ashwin-wkt-308,"47.3 gets him straight away! Has he? Markram reviews. It's a late cut, that looks very much like an edge. Everyone behind the bat is excited, as is Ashwin. Oh he's reviewed because he's connected with the back pad as he plays the shot. But he has connected with the ball at the same time. This will remain out. His affair with the 90s must be a painful one. Top class innings ends tamely. It was a back of a length ball in the corridor and he was looking to play the late cut 148/2",,Keeper,Ashwin
57,309,Q de Kock,caught,V Kohli,0,1,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,13-Jan-18,Test # 2293,ashwin-wkt-309,"81.1 gets him first ball! India are back in this! Length ball, dipping outside off. QDK wafts at it with no feet, following the ball only with his hands. It's lazy. And quite unlike Kohli at slip, who reacts quickly to grab to his left. That flew quickly to him 250/5",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
57,310,M Morkel,caught,M Vijay,6,1,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,13-Jan-18,Test # 2293,ashwin-wkt-310,113.5 thick outside edge as Morne looks to drill this full ball over cover. Vijay gets under it at sweeper cover and takes it. Ashwin tossed this up wide outside off and drew him in 335/10,,Outfield,Ashwin
57,311,L Ngidi,caught,M Vijay,1,3,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,13-Jan-18,Test # 2293,ashwin-wkt-311,"91.3 gets great connection on the slog but he's found long-on. Tossed up at middle stump, he ends the solid batsman charade and swings with his front foot out of the way. Long-on was a few yards in and had to leap to take this with a reverse cup. Well connected, but flat enough to keep that fielder in the game 258/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
58,312,Asghar Afghan,bowled,,11,2,v Afghanistan,Bengaluru,India,14-Jun-18,Test # 2307,ashwin-wkt-312,"12.3 oh, what a delivery! Beautifully done. Had everything you want from a spinner: flight, turn, bounce, and the ideal length. Tosses it up invitingly to draw the batsman forward. Stanikzai is on to the front foot and the ball just spins in sharply to beat the inside edge and the bounce is just low enough to clip the bails 50/5",,,Ashwin
58,313,Hashmatullah Shahidi,lbw,,11,2,v Afghanistan,Bengaluru,India,14-Jun-18,Test # 2307,ashwin-wkt-313,"16.4 this one's plumb. Will they review again? Yes, Shahidi goes for it, but this looks out. Pitches at just short of a good length. Shahidi is expecting it to turn away but the ball comes on with the arm to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Could it be heading down leg? Hard to say with the angle. We will have to wait for ball-tracking. Hitting inside part of middle. That's gone 59/6",,,Ashwin
58,314,Yamin Ahmadzai,caught,RA Jadeja,0,2,v Afghanistan,Bengaluru,India,14-Jun-18,Test # 2307,ashwin-wkt-314,"24.5 Another impatient shot, another wicket. Carrom ball from Ashwin, nicely looped up on off, Ahmadzai aims to lift it over mid-on or midwicket. Instead, he skews a catch to Jadeja at backward point. Gone for a nine-ball duck 87/8",,InField,Ashwin
58,315,Mohammad Nabi,caught,I Sharma,24,2,v Afghanistan,Bengaluru,India,14-Jun-18,Test # 2307,ashwin-wkt-315,"26.3 Ashwin tosses an offbreak on off stump, Nabi aims to drag it with the break over midwicket. But he ends up miscuing it off the bottom of the bat. Vijay runs back from short leg, Ishant runs in from deep square leg. The latter dives forward and snaffles a sharp catch 88/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
58,316,Wafadar Momand,bowled,,0,3,v Afghanistan,Bengaluru,India,14-Jun-18,Test # 2307,ashwin-wkt-316,"38.4 That is that! Done in two days. Ashwin lobs up an offbreak outside off, turns back in, Wafadar misjudges it and simply shoulders arms. The ball turns in to hit middle stump. Wafadar is left with a wry smile on his face 103/10",,,Ashwin
59,317,AN Cook,bowled,,13,1,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-317,"8.5 cleaned him up with a beauty! Memories of the tour to India in this one. Drifts into middle stump, Cook plays forward, grips to spin past the outside edge and into the off stump. Lovely piece of bowling 26/1",,,Ashwin
59,318,JC Buttler,lbw,,0,1,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-318,"66.4 given lbw and England are collapsing Buttler isn't reviewing. He's basically played across a straight ball. It turned a little, but he shouldn't be missing that. Struck on the knee roll 224/6",,,Ashwin
59,319,BA Stokes,caught,R Ashwin,21,1,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-319,"74.1 got him! This is the polar opposite of how Ben Stokes plays his cricket - soft. Short of a length ball on middle and leg. He's been whipping those with the angle all this while, but this one grips and holds its line. Some extra bounce too and it floats back at Ashwin off the leading edge. He's had a lot of happy moments today. Flashes another grin. 243/7",,Return catch,Ashwin
59,320,SCJ Broad,lbw,,1,1,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-320,"84.2 that looks plumb. It's given. Broad won't even talk about the review. It's that swinging delivery from Ashwin again. Full, with the seam pointed at leg slip. Shapes back in and beats the inside edge as he looks to defend for the turn. He's struck right in front of the middle. Little doubt there 283/9",,,Ashwin
59,321,AN Cook,bowled,,0,3,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-321,"3.4 hello, time traveller, it's August 1 again. Ashwin has got one to dip on middle stump, drawn Cook forward, and zipped past his outside edge to hit off stump once again. Cannot get any more similar to his first innings dismissal. Half-hearted forward stride with the bat playing for the one that slides on. But the dip has done him 9/1",,,Ashwin
59,322,KK Jennings,caught,KL Rahul,8,3,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-322,"7.4 edged and taken at second slip! Ashwin's enjoying the England left handers. Good length on off stump, Jennings presses forward, it straightens to take the outside edge and it's a neat grab 18/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
59,323,JE Root,caught,KL Rahul,14,3,v England,Birmingham,England,01-Aug-18,Test # 2314,ashwin-wkt-323,"15.1 this is a brilliant catch at leg slip! Goes back to a shorter delivery, works it off his pads, comes off the face of the bat, Rahul stays low at leg slip and holds a wonderful snaffle by his bootlaces. Might even have bounced off his knee into his hands 39/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
61,324,JM Anderson,caught,AM Rahane,11,4,v England,Nottingham,England,18-Aug-18,Test # 2316,ashwin-wkt-324,"104.5 is that it? It is. Ashwin takes the last wicket with a legbreak. Shortish outside off, turns sharply into Anderson and gets big on him as he makes room to cut. Ends up gloving it up over the slips, and Rahane backtracks from first slip to take the simplest of catches 317/10",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
62,325,MM Ali,caught,JJ Bumrah,40,1,v England,Southampton,England,30-Aug-18,Test # 2317,ashwin-wkt-325,"59.3 tossed up straight, Moeen goes for the slog-sweep... but the top edge is pouched by Bumrah running in at midwicket! There's the partnership-breaker, Moeen falls trying to take on the spinner. Not a great shot, but the ball nearly landed safely, Bumrah had to cover some distance before sliding to hold the catch 167/7",,InField,Ashwin
62,326,SM Curran,bowled,,78,1,v England,Southampton,England,30-Aug-18,Test # 2317,ashwin-wkt-326,"76.4 bowled him, and England are bowled out for 246. Clears his front leg to try and launch this over midwicket. Ashwin slows it down just enough, and he ends up swinging too early, and losing middle stump 246/10",,,Ashwin
62,327,BA Stokes,caught,AM Rahane,30,3,v England,Southampton,England,30-Aug-18,Test # 2317,ashwin-wkt-327,"68.1 taken at slip and Ashwin bursts into a smile! He looks a relieved man as he wheels away in celebration, having lobbed a well flighted delivery onto Stokes' off stump and drawing the left-hander's outside edge. Rahane does very well to get it to stick in his hands, moving to his left. Excellent innings from Stokes, full of restraint and that he lasted 110 balls shows he has the technique to bat this way too 178/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
63,328,SD Hope,bowled,,10,2,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-328,"9.2 beauty. This one drifts in and skids through to clip top of off as Hope plays inside the line to be beaten. This is terrific from Ashwin. Hope played for turn when there was none here. The ball hit the stumps and deflected towards Pant's face. Initially, the reaction from everyone suggested this missed the stumps. 21/3",,,Ashwin
63,329,RL Chase,bowled,,53,2,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-329,"43.2 what a ball! Oh that is vicious from Ashwin. A dipping, drifting, flighted ball outside off stump lulls Chase into a loose shot. Looks to drive on the up, against the turn with a massive gap between bat and pad. This is a proper set up, because Chase has barely been made to stretch outside off against spin. Gets an inside edge and it's into the stumps 159/8",,,Ashwin
63,330,SH Lewis,bowled,,0,2,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-330,"43.5 takes it away from middle and hits off stump. Runs his fingers through this like a legcutter and it's on a length at middle stump. Lewis goes on the back foot to defend for the offbreak, but this has ripped away quickly to clean him up. He doesn't know what's happened, stares blankly at the non-striker 159/9",,,Ashwin
63,331,ST Gabriel,stumped,RR Pant,1,2,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-331,"47.6 sent upstairs for the stumping. It looks out. A good stumping. Nervous gather from Pant, but his hands are quick after he has the ball. Gabriel has lifted his back leg after Ashwin spins one away from a full length on off stump. 181/10",,,Ashwin
63,332,KC Brathwaite,caught,PP Shaw,10,3,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-332,"7.6 bunts it straight to short leg. That's soft. No extra bounce, no bat-pad, no inside edge. It's a length ball on off, spinning into leg stump and he pushes it straight to Shaw, who barely has to move as he takes this. A strange sequence leading into that wicket. Seemed to have lost all composure 32/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
63,333,D Bishoo,caught,RR Pant,9,3,v West Indies,Rajkot,India,04-Oct-18,Test # 2319,ashwin-wkt-333,"43.6 there may have been some noise as Bishoo looked to sweep this with the angle. Pant did well to get across to his right and catch. Was there some glove? Yes, replays confirm there was glove on it, so India have reviewed and they get it right. Bishoo is gone and that's tea  185/8",,Keeper,Ashwin
64,334,KOA Powell,caught,RA Jadeja,22,1,v West Indies,Hyderabad,India,12-Oct-18,Test # 2321,ashwin-wkt-334,"11.1 what have you done, Powell? This is clever bowling from Ashwin, but you've got to say Powell has given his wicket away on a platter. Stepped out to go over the top, Ashwin saw him coming and shortened his length and bowled it a touch wide, he reached out to go inside-out but ended up chipping it straight to Jadeja at the end of the ring at cover. 32/1",,InField,Ashwin
64,335,KOA Powell,caught,AM Rahane,0,3,v West Indies,Hyderabad,India,12-Oct-18,Test # 2321,ashwin-wkt-335,"3.3 soft signal is out for a catch at slip. Powell has pushed with hard hands at a length ball turning away from him. Rahane lunges low to his left and takes this from close to the ground. Looks like the two ring fingers are under the ball, but you can't tell for sure if it's hit the turf...remember, there has to be conclusive evidence of the ball touching grass. And there isn't conclusive evidence. The screen flashes out and India have a second. Nicely lured by Ashwin, that drifted in and forced him to play unlike the last one which he had left. Powell not too happy with the decision. But going by the rules in such cases, that is the correct decision. 6/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
64,336,JA Warrican,bowled,,7,3,v West Indies,Hyderabad,India,12-Oct-18,Test # 2321,ashwin-wkt-336,45.2 off stump goes out. That's a subtle deception from Ashwin. Wide of the crease as he bowls this at a length. He looks to defend for the one that comes in but this holds its line to go past the outside edge 126/9,,,Ashwin
65,337,MS Harris,caught,M Vijay,26,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-337,"21.1 caught at silly mid off! Brilliantly bowled from Ashwin. It was flighted and drifting in full, he pressed forward to defend, it skidded on, took the inside edge, onto pad and popped up to Vijay at silly mid off who took a very simple catch! Big breakthrough 45/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
65,338,SE Marsh,bowled,,2,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-338,"27.6 dragged on! Ashwin entices the drive and Marsh falls for it. This was nicely floated up, nice and wide, Marsh reaches out to force this through covers but doesn't get to the pitch and ends up dragging back. India strike immediately after lunch. Shaun Marsh's career against Ashwin: Five dismissals at an average of 1.60 59/3",,,Ashwin
65,339,UT Khawaja,caught,RR Pant,28,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-339,"39.3 beautiful bowling this from Ashwin. Nice flight, lands this on length and gets this to spin away. Khawaja looking to smother this but doesn't get to the pitch, this dips and spins away to flick the glove on the way to Pant, who rose with the bounce to come up with an excellent grab. Decision overturned. The key was that Khawaja had to play at this. He'll look back and think he couldn't have done much, that was a corker from Ashwin. 87/4",,Keeper,Ashwin
65,340,AJ Finch,caught,RR Pant,11,4,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-340,"11.6 big wicket for India, Finch thinks of a review but decides to walk. It's the dip from Ashwin that has done him in, beautiful bowling. Presses forward to one that is nicely tossed up, there's enough turn and bounce off the deck to lob off the pad, then a bit of glove? Doesn't look like on replay. Pant grabs the lob. Spring in India's steps as they walk off for tea. Could he have reviewed? Possibly, because replays don't conclusively prove there was a glove. May have been a very, very thin one if at all, but well worth going up if he wasn't entirely sure. That's history now. 28/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
65,341,UT Khawaja,caught,RG Sharma,8,4,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-341,"23.3 Khawaja has committed hara-kiri here! Running down the pitch to loft him over mid-off, but it's the flight and dip that consumes Khawaja as he ends up slicing it towards deep extra cover. This swirls in the air for a while, Rohit briefly trembles. Takes a step back, then comes forward, steadies himself and yet sees the ball nearly die on him, but he moves low and takes this. Never easy those catches, but Rohit held on quite nicely. Ashwin's flight and guile accounts for Khawaja and Australia are in real trouble now. 60/3",,Outfield,Ashwin
65,342,JR Hazlewood,caught,KL Rahul,13,4,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,06-Dec-18,Test # 2333,ashwin-wkt-342,"119.5 edged and caught at second! India win! Ashwin the hero! Beautifully bowled. He flighted this, loop, drift and drop outside off, lured a drive, it spins away, he gets an edge, it flies low to KL Rahul and he clutches it just above the turf! 291/10",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
66,343,AK Markram,bowled,,5,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-343,"7.1 GOT 'IM! This time it doesn't bounce over the stumps. Ashwin tosses this up outside off, with some furious revs on it, and Markram presses forward to defend. Leaves a slight gap between bat and pad, though, and that's where the ball sneaks through and goes on to rattle the timber behind him. Ashwin throws his right arm up in celebration. Smart bowling, as he's giving the ball some flight, but keeps varying the line and length 14/1",,,Ashwin
66,344,TB de Bruyn,caught,WP Saha,4,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-344,"16.3 Ashwin gets de Bruyn...superb glovework from Saha! Floated up around off stump, and it just kept going with the angle. De Bruyn has been happy to use his reach to try and get to the pitch of the ball often, and his back leg just slid a shade out of the crease as he did so, and that instant was enough for Saha to whip the bails off. In fact, given out caught, as there was a slight inside edge on that. So de Bruyn may have been given out in any case, but he was honest enough to start walking as soon as that ball was snaffled by Saha behind the stumps. It continues to be a terrific opening burst from R Ashwin 31/2",,Keeper,Ashwin
66,345,F du Plessis,caught,CA Pujara,55,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-345,"57.3 he's nudged that straight to leg slip! Oh that is soft, Faf is livid with himself. Ashwin slows it down and gets him to push in front of the body. It's a length ball landed just outside off. A hint of bounce to that. He closes the face and hits it into the mid-riff of Pujara who grabs onto it. A solid knock ends tamely 178/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
66,346,Q de Kock,bowled,,111,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-346,"109.3 the three-ball trick works for Ashwin! Started with one that turned sharp, the next one just a tad lesser, and this went on straight with the arm, and went through the gate as de Kock stretched to defend. Two balls that beat the outside edge, and this one crept right through to go on and castle him. Nevertheless, what a top innings this has been from de Kock. Taken a massive amount of pressure off South Africa! 370/7",,,Ashwin
66,347,VD Philander,bowled,,0,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-347,"113.2 what a beauty to pick up five! Floated around off, and Philander looks for the drive. It turns and spins back in through the gate, and just clips the top of middle and leg. Ashwin applauds...I think he likes how the ball is coming out today 376/8",,,Ashwin
66,348,KA Maharaj,caught,MA Agarwal,9,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-348,"123.4 Ashwin gets a sixth! Tossed up a bit more, and outside off, and Maharaj looks to go towards long on. Mayank Agarwal was placed a few yards close in from the long on fence, and just had to take a few steps forward to his right, and had an easy catch to complete. Skewed in the hands as he went for that shot, Maharaj, and that ends his resistance. Just one wicket to go now for India 396/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
66,349,K Rabada,lbw,,15,2,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-349,"131.2 goes back to one and tries to defend. Hits him on the pads, but not given out. India review this one. Ball pitches around middle and then goes further on, but it still goes on to strike the leg stump. India have that final wicket, and Rabada becomes Ashwin's seventh victim 431/10",,,Ashwin
66,350,TB de Bruyn,bowled,,10,4,v South Africa,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Oct-19,Test # 2363,ashwin-wkt-350,"10.5 WICKET NUMBER 350 FOR ASHWIN! Tosses this up wide of off, and gives some supreme revs on this one. De Bruyn shapes to cut this away, but finds the ball dipping late on him. He's committed to the stroke, though, and ends up playing it off the inside edge on to his stumps. Ashwin lets out a celebratory roar - he now joins Muttiah Muralitharan as the only men to have reached 350 Test wickets in just their 66th Test. Take a bow! 19/2",Yes,,Ashwin
67,351,Q de Kock,bowled,,31,2,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-351,"37.6 beauty from Ashwin That's knocked over the stumps. De Kock is hanging around, thinking Saha's gloves knocked the bails off, but it was all Ashwin's doing. Tossed up, making him thinking about planting the front foot again perhaps, dips beautifully on him, and de Kock is caught on the crease, feet not moving. Pitches on middle and leg, and spins past a limply hanging bat to knock off the bails. Brilliant. 128/6",,,Ashwin
67,352,F du Plessis,caught,AM Rahane,64,2,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-352,"58.3 Ashwin finds the outside edge this time, and Rahane snaps up the catch at slip. This one goes straight just outside off - as opposed to breaking in - Faf jabs at it and nicks it off 162/8",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
67,353,KA Maharaj,caught,RG Sharma,72,2,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-353,"101.4 caught at leg slip A superb innings by Maharaj but Ashwin ends it. Gets some drift on this and it is on leg stump, Maharaj is looking to flick it away, gets a thin edge onto pad and straight to Rohit Sharma. The Indians are jubilant, but this has been a fantastic knock by Maharaj, with a sore shoulder too. 271/9",,Close-in,Ashwin
67,354,K Rabada,lbw,,2,2,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-354,"105.4 given out lbw but Rabada is reviewing. That's only because they have a review left. It looked pretty plumb. And DRS confirms that's three reds, so that will end South Africa's innings. Nice loop from around the wicket, pitches on middle and leg and goes almost straight on. He's playing down the wrong line to defend, expecting it to turn, but it hits his pad. Would have crashed into leg stump. 275/10",,,Ashwin
67,355,F du Plessis,caught,WP Saha,5,3,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-355,"23.3 Whoa! Has Saha pouched it on the rebound? Faf has been given out caught behind. Ashwin tosses an offbreak, gets it to turn in, Faf inches forward, prods at it and inside-edges it onto the pad. It dies on Saha. One. Two. Three... Saha plunges forward and takes it on the fourth attempt inches from the ground. 70/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
67,356,D Elgar,caught,UT Yadav,48,3,v South Africa,Pune,India,10-Oct-19,Test # 2364,ashwin-wkt-356,"25.2 Ooops, what was that, Elgar? It worked for him in Vizag, here he holes out to mid-off running back. Umesh just about clings onto the catch on the third attempt. Ashwin loops it up on off, dips and turns. Elgar isn't quite close enough to the pitch and winds up slicing the ball as opposed to lofting it. He was aiming to hit it over mid-on, but Umesh grabs it on the rebound from mid-off. Sixth in the game for Ashwin 71/4",,InField,Ashwin
68,357,K Rabada,caught,RA Jadeja,12,3,v South Africa,Ranchi,India,19-Oct-19,Test # 2365,ashwin-wkt-357,"42.5 Ashwin gets that wicket! Tossed up around middle and leg, and he has a wild slog at this. Off the top edge and runs towards Jadeja at point this time, and he gleefully accepts it 121/8",,InField,Ashwin
69,358,Mominul Haque,bowled,,37,1,v Bangladesh,Indore,India,14-Nov-19,Test # 2366,ashwin-wkt-358,"37.1 misjudgment has cost Mominul big time! It's the slider from around the wicket. Drifts back in a long way, Mominul leaves thinking this will turn but it doesn't and crashes into the off stump. A wicket well-deserved for Ashwin and the skipper's gone. Ashwin's 250th Test wicket at home  99/4",,,Ashwin
69,359,Mahmudullah,bowled,,10,1,v Bangladesh,Indore,India,14-Nov-19,Test # 2366,ashwin-wkt-359,"45.1  so what if you can't take catches? I'll get them bowled' , or so Ashwin seems to say as he's pumped! Mahmudullah plays a very, very poor stroke. Goes way across to sweep and misses a straight delivery that crashes into the stumps. 115/5",,,Ashwin
69,360,Litton Das,caught,R Ashwin,35,3,v Bangladesh,Indore,India,14-Nov-19,Test # 2366,ashwin-wkt-360,"39.2 steps out to hit over the top, can't get the elevation and Ashwin takes a smart return catch. Mind you, this was hit hard and was travelling but Ashwin instinctively moved to his left and took it right besides his face. A flourishing partnership has been broken just as Bangladesh were beginning to feel a lot better. 135/6",,Return catch,Ashwin
69,361,Mushfiqur Rahim,caught,CA Pujara,64,3,v Bangladesh,Indore,India,14-Nov-19,Test # 2366,ashwin-wkt-361,"67.5 brilliant catch from Pujara. A touch fuller around off, Mushfiqur looks to go over mid-off, fails to middle. Pujara runs sideways and behind from mid-off, keeping his eyes on the ball all the time and takes it over his right shoulder 208/9",,InField,Ashwin
69,362,Ebadot Hossain,caught,UT Yadav,1,3,v Bangladesh,Indore,India,14-Nov-19,Test # 2366,ashwin-wkt-362,"69.2 and India take 1-0 lead in the series. A length ball around off, Ebadot comes down the track and looks to smash it out of Indore, but ends up skying it towards long-on where Umesh settles under it and takes it comfortably before tumbling to his left 213/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
71,363,HM Nicholls,caught,V Kohli,17,2,v New Zealand,Wellington,New Zealand,21-Feb-20,Test # 2385,ashwin-wkt-363,"69.5 Ashwin gets the left-hander. A low catch to his right by Kohli at second slip/gully. Was a length ball around middle and leg, didn't turn much maybe just straightened but Nicholls stretched his front foot straight down instead of towards the ball and as a result, got squared up. A thick outside edge that was dying on its way but Kohli got his hands under it. Suddenly, it looks much better for India 207/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
71,364,KA Jamieson,caught,GH Vihari,44,2,v New Zealand,Wellington,New Zealand,21-Feb-20,Test # 2385,ashwin-wkt-364,"90.2 holes out! Full on middle, and Jamieson goes for the big one once again. Toe-ends the shot on this occasion, and Vihari, at long on, runs to his right to complete the catch. 296/8",,Outfield,Ashwin
71,365,C de Grandhomme,caught,RR Pant,43,2,v New Zealand,Wellington,New Zealand,21-Feb-20,Test # 2385,ashwin-wkt-365,"94.2 good length, on leg stump and turning further down. De Grandhomme tries to flick, but it gets a touch off his glove and Pant takes a catch down the leg side. Loud appeal and umpire Kettleborough was late in raising his finger, but eventually does, perhaps because the batsman was walking off already. An excellent innings from de Grandhomme 310/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
72,366,SPD Smith,caught,AM Rahane,1,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,17-Dec-20,Test # 2396,ashwin-wkt-366,"26.6 got him, Ashwin has struck with an absolute beauty! He got Smith like this in Dharamsala in 2017, but that was from around the wicket. I don't know if this was meant to go on straight or if it was just natural variation, but he plays back to a length ball just outside off, and it skids through quick, takes the outside edge of his defensive bat, and straight into Ajinkya Rahane's lap at slip. Almost seemed to leave Smith off the pitch, kind of like the Mohammad Nabi arm ball 45/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
72,367,TM Head,caught,R Ashwin,7,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,17-Dec-20,Test # 2396,ashwin-wkt-367,"34.4 gone, Ashwin has two! This was flighted, on middle and off or thereabouts, and Head doesn't get a proper stride in to drive. Gets his front leg out of the way because he's worried about lbw, and then looks to clip into the on side, but the ball dips, straightens, hits the outside half of the bat, and pops right back to the bowler at chest height. India are all over Australia now. 65/4",,Return catch,Ashwin
72,368,C Green,caught,V Kohli,11,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,17-Dec-20,Test # 2396,ashwin-wkt-368,"40.3 Kohli lunges low to his right and holds on at midwicket! We saw Lyon extracting bounce from this pitch, and Ashwin has done that with this ball too, albeit it's a short one turning into leg stump. It's there for the pull, but pulling in front of square is hard when there's bounce. Green looks to go over midwicket, it hits the high part of his bat and floats out to Kohli's right. He tracks it and times the leap to his right perfectly. These can be hard if you go early. Kohli goes with both hands and completes the landing perfectly before he takes a bow. Not a bad first innings from Green at all, certainly looked comfortable at the crease, but he doesn't do it long enough 79/5",,InField,Ashwin
72,369,NM Lyon,caught,V Kohli,10,2,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,17-Dec-20,Test # 2396,ashwin-wkt-369,"66.5 chipped straight to short midwicket. It is a slow pitch, and that's on display here. Short of a length, cross-seam offbreak into the hips. He wants to turn that behind square off the back foot but closes the face early. Kohli holds on, smiles wide and breaths a sigh of relief 167/9",,InField,Ashwin
72,370,M Labuschagne,caught,MA Agarwal,6,4,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,17-Dec-20,Test # 2396,ashwin-wkt-370,"19.5 taken at mid-on. Ashwin still on the mark like he was in the first innings. Beautifully dipping length ball just outside off, slowing it down because Labuschagne has looked impatient. Steps out and looks to cart it over midwicket. It drops on him and then gets big. He can only sky it 82/2",,InField,Ashwin
73,371,MS Wade,caught,RA Jadeja,30,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-20,Test # 2398,ashwin-wkt-371,"12.5 Oh, Matt Wade! What have you done? Going for a glory hit so soon? Steps out to take him on, Ashwin gets this to dip and turn, Wade heaves across the line to get a top-edge. Now, Gill runs back from midwicket, Jadeja to his left from mid-on. There's confusion, it seems as if both of them will collide. They do, but Jadeja just manages to hang on as this descends on them. Mighty relief in the Indian camp. I could almost imagine fielding coach R Sridhar flinging his cap in disgust had that gone down. What a big moment. Ashwin into the act straightaway and India have taken the first hour. 35/2",,InField,Ashwin
73,372,SPD Smith,caught,CA Pujara,0,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-20,Test # 2398,ashwin-wkt-372,"14.3 big, big moment. Smith has glanced one to Pujara at leg gully. Ashwin bowls one down the leg side, not sure how much that was part of the plan but Smith couldn't help and looks to get off the mark. Makes the connection alright but ends up hitting it straight to Pujara, who tumbles to complete the catch. Smith fetches a blob, means he has two runs in three innings with one not-out for Smith so far in this series 38/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
73,373,TD Paine,caught,GH Vihari,13,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-20,Test # 2398,ashwin-wkt-373,"62.6 there's a third for Ashwin as Paine has nudged this to backward short leg. Held the length back, got it to dip and turn, Paine went with hard hands and that is an excellent catch from Vihari. Australia crumbling. 155/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
73,374,M Labuschagne,caught,AM Rahane,28,3,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-20,Test # 2398,ashwin-wkt-374,"17.5 Ashwin shows his class once again, pushes one across Labuschagne, it's a length ball around middle and off, Labuschagne has to play it but he is stuck on the back foot. Looks to defend but the ball goes the other way, takes the outside edge and a simple catch for Rahane at slip 42/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
73,375,JR Hazlewood,bowled,,10,3,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-20,Test # 2398,ashwin-wkt-375,103.1 shoulders arms and that hits off stump! Good length ball at a middle and leg stump line. He leaves expecting that to turn away more than it did. Off stump was completely exposed and Ashwin found the top of it 200/10,,,Ashwin
74,376,DA Warner,lbw,,13,3,v Australia,Sydney,Australia,07-Jan-21,Test # 2402,ashwin-wkt-376,"9.2 he's trapped him lbw but Warner wants to review this, almost immediately. Was floated up on a length and going straight on, Warner went for the slog-sweep. The ball wasn't full enough for it, so he misses it entirely and is struck on the back leg. Hawkeye says umpire's call on impact, so Warner will have to be on his way. Ashwin has had the wood over him historically, and does it again. 35/2",,,Ashwin
74,377,SPD Smith,lbw,,81,3,v Australia,Sydney,Australia,07-Jan-21,Test # 2402,ashwin-wkt-377,"67.4 a big appeal for lbw Denied but India want to review this. Tossed up around off on a length, Smith came on the front foot to defend but missed as the ball turned. Was there an inside edge? No spike there and it hits the knee roll in the line of the stumps. Would have gone on to hit the leg stick. India find a wicket from nowehere. Smith isn't happy with himself 208/5",,,Ashwin
75,378,RJ Burns,caught,RR Pant,33,1,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-378,"23.5 what have you done, Rory Burns? Fourth ball from over the wicket, and Burns looks to take on the reverse-sweep off a length ball on the stumps. Through his shot too eagerly and too early, and the ball lobs up off his gloves for the simplest of catches to Pant 63/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
75,379,OJ Pope,lbw,,34,1,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-379,"152.2 gives him out lbw and Pope will not avail himself of a review. Good call in the end. he's right in front of middle.Good work from Ashwin. Even with this pitch not offering any turn, he has found a way to hoodwink a batsman. Pope is playing for this non-existent, mythical turn. He is playing down the wrong line. And a full length ball pitching on off stump casually drifts past the leading edge of the bat and pins him 473/5",,,Ashwin
75,380,JM Anderson,bowled,,1,1,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-380,"190.1 Ashwin wraps up England's innings with the third new ball. Tossed up on middle, full, doesn't turn, Anderson stretches out for the slog-sweep, but the ball dips and rattles the stumps 578/10",,,Ashwin
75,381,RJ Burns,caught,AM Rahane,0,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-381,"0.1 and he gets Burns first ball! Perfect delivery to start, angling in and hitting a good length just outside off. Draws Burns forward to defend, and there's turn and bounce to get the shoulder of the bat, and Rahane takes a sharp catch because it was travelling quickly 0/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
75,382,DP Sibley,caught,CA Pujara,16,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-382,"10.6 Looped to Pujara at leg-slip this time. Ashwin tosses this up on middle from around the wicket, straightens, turns, and bounces to find the inside edge to loop to leg slip. Two wickets for Ashwin with the new ball. Silverwood didn't quite enjoy that for sure 32/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
75,383,BA Stokes,caught,RR Pant,7,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-383,"18.1 number three for Ashwin. Tossed up outside off, drops just short of a driving length and spins away. Drives away from his body, looking to go through the covers, and gets a thin edge through to Pant 71/4",,Keeper,Ashwin
75,384,DM Bess,lbw,,25,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-384,"42.1 lbw playing back to one that skids on quickly off the pitch while spinning back into him. Hit on the back leg. Given out by Anil Chaudhary, and Bess has reviewed... Close, this. The bat gets jammed behind the flap of the back pad as it comes down to defend, and it's hard to say whether the ball hit the flap of the pad first or the bat. Definitely hit both. Pad first is the verdict after a look at ultra edge, and the ball strikes him in line with off stump and is hitting middle stump according to ball tracking. Fourth wicket for Ashwin 167/8",,,Ashwin
75,385,JC Archer,bowled,,5,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-385,"46.1 five! Quick, just back of a length, and it spins in a long way from outside off stump to bowl Archer, whose feet have moved nowhere and whose bat comes down too late to keep the ball out 178/9",,,Ashwin
75,386,JM Anderson,caught,R Ashwin,0,3,v England,Chennai,India,05-Feb-21,Test # 2409,ashwin-wkt-386,"46.3 and that is that. Ashwin ends up with a six-fer. Angled into the stumps, hits that length where the No. 11, not really fully forward, looks to play the angle with a closed face. Leading edge balloons straight back to the bowler, and India will need 420 to win this. 178/10",,Return catch,Ashwin
76,387,DP Sibley,caught,V Kohli,16,2,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-387,"7.2 another appeal by India, this one's for the catch. Not given once again. But India choose to review this. Did this brush the glove on the way up? Pushed through on middle, Sibley goes for the sweep, but Ashwin finds extra bounce. Sibley thinks he's gone and walks off. Ultra Edge confirms that it kissed the back of the bat on the way to Kohli at leg-slip 16/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
76,388,DW Lawrence,caught,Shubman Gill,9,2,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-388,"17.6 Lawrence has been put out of his misery - out off the last ball before lunch. He slumps to his knees. Ashwin pushes it through, attacking the stumps from around the wicket. He finds turn and bounce, another ball that disturbs the surface. Lawrence jabs in front of his body and pops a catch to Gill at short leg 39/4",,Close-in,Ashwin
76,389,BA Stokes,bowled,,18,2,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-389,"23.2 bowled him, Stokes has missed a half-volley. It can happen when the bowler gets the kind of drift Ashwin does, but Stokes might still be disappointed with himself. Drifted in, and he looked to clip that towards midwicket, and that's a dangerous thing to do from a stump-to-stump line. Turns past his bat, and hits off stump 52/5",,,Ashwin
76,390,OP Stone,caught,RG Sharma,1,2,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-390,"49.2 chipped straight to Rohit at short midwicket. Full offbreak, spins in at off stump, Stone pushes forward and picks out the fielder 106/8",,InField,Ashwin
76,391,SCJ Broad,bowled,,0,2,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-391,"59.5 he doesn't need any fielders, really. Full, too full to sweep, and too straight. He barely manages to get all the way down, and just about manages a bottom-edge into his stumps. Second consecutive five-for for Ashwin, he's bowled beautifully through this series so far. And he leads India off the field and gets a warm reception from his home crowd 134/10",,,Ashwin
76,392,RJ Burns,caught,V Kohli,25,4,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-392,"15.6 edged and grabbed at slip. Ashwin loops it up into off stump, dips nicely too. Burns closes his bat-face and eyes up the leg side. Instead, he nicks it off to Kohli at second slip. Good overhead catch. The Ashwin show rolls on at Chepauk 49/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
76,393,DW Lawrence,stumped,RR Pant,26,4,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-393,"25.1 got him, that's smartly bowled, and great work behind the stumps too! Lawrence steps out too early, and Ashwin fires in a quick offbreak that spins between his legs as he misses the hurried flick. The turn takes Pant a long way down the leg side to collect the ball, and from there he throws himself to his right to complete the stumping 66/4",,,Ashwin
76,394,BA Stokes,caught,V Kohli,8,4,v England,Chennai,India,13-Feb-21,Test # 2411,ashwin-wkt-394,"37.6 this is much fuller, slides in from around the wicket, as opposed to turning away once again. A crease-bound Stokes prods at the ball, playing for turn, inside-edged onto the pad, and it loops behind to Kohli, who dives forward to grab the ball at second slip, throwing himself in front of first. Ashwin gets Stokes once again. India are five away from victory 90/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
77,395,JE Root,lbw,,17,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-395,"21.5 fuller, and he has played back to one where he really should have come forward. Given out, but Root reviews! Ashwin's angle from around the stumps, and his ability to vary his line will always bring his mode of dismissal into play, especially with these two players showing a keenness to play back. This has missed the inside edge of the bat, and straightened enough to hit the top of leg stump. Stays with umpire's call, and that's a massive wicket for India 74/3",,,Ashwin
77,396,OJ Pope,bowled,,1,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-396,"27.4 rips out off stump! Round the wicket, Pope plays down the wrong line and is beaten on the outside edge. The ball pings into the top of the off stump, pegging it back, and Pope goes for just 1. Ashwin has his second. Played for the turn, but it skidded on with the angle. Pitched on leg stump, a bit of drift, and Pope is nowhere near it 81/5",,,Ashwin
77,397,MJ Leach,caught,CA Pujara,3,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-397,"37.3 tight to the stumps, draws the edge, and gully snaffles the catch! Ashwin has three, India have eight. Length ball, which spun away from the bat and drew an edge. It looked like it carried to the man at gully/second slip, but they're checking for a fair catch. Soft signal is out. Pujara was in tight, left knee to the ground, right knee up. Did he just about manage to grab this cleanly? Hard to tell from either of the angles the TV umpire has seen so far. Looked to me like he managed to sneak his fingertips underneath it, but it's so hard to tell from this angle, and it sounds like there isn't a better one available. ""Nice and slow,"" Mr Shamshuddin says. There's a stump cam angle too, and from there it looks like a clean catch... and the big screen confirms it. Leach goes! 98/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
77,398,BA Stokes,lbw,,25,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-398,"17.2 Ashwin wins an lbw appeal from Menon, and celebrates. Ashwin nabs Stokes again. Stokes has a word with his captain and walks off. Pushed through fuller and quicker, skidding in at middle, at 94.5ks, from around the wicket. Straightens and clatters into the pad. Stokes suggests to Root that he hasn't nicked it and simply walks off. Given the extra bounce Ashwin has been getting with the new-ish pink ball, it might not have been a bad option to review this... 50/4",,,Ashwin
77,399,OJ Pope,bowled,,12,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-399,"21.6 bowls him, off stump! Sensational from Ashwin, and he's on to 399! Thought it might have been a carrom ball, as it seemed to dart away from Pope, who was pinned to the crease, working across the line - but no, released with his usual grip, just going on impishly to disturb the woodwork. Number of the Beast for England! 66/6",,,Ashwin
77,400,JC Archer,lbw,,0,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-400,"23.2 full and straight, hit on the boot, 400 up for Ashwin! Archer has barely moved his front foot forward and swipes at it, misses to be pinned in front... The review is in vain, Hawk-Eye has it demolishing middle stump! Ashwin raises an arm to acknowledge the swell of cheers from the crowd. The shootout continues 68/7",Yes,,Ashwin
77,401,MJ Leach,caught,AM Rahane,9,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,24-Feb-21,Test # 2412,ashwin-wkt-401,"29.4 sliced into the bread basket of slip! Leach decides that his best option is to try and flay a few more, but doesn't get near the pitch, the ball spins and a thick edge squirts to Kohli, who knows his team are closing in on 2-1 here (tricky chase notwithstanding) 80/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
78,402,OJ Pope,caught,Shubman Gill,29,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-402,"61.3 Ashwin gets Pope for the third straight time! Pops it to short leg. Bat-pad and then lobs to the right of short leg, where Gill snaffles it. Pope dares to step out to Ashwin once again. The bowler held this back, gave it more air, dipped at Pope. He still has a crack at it, having stepped down the track, and chips an inside edge which loops off the back pad to the close-in fielder 166/6",,Close-in,Ashwin
78,403,BT Foakes,caught,AM Rahane,1,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-403,"65.4 big fat edge and there goes another! Rahane at slip, keeping low to scoop up the chance, as Ashwin slides the floater off the edge of a lunging blade from Foakes, who was set up by a big turner the previous ball and done all in by the next! 170/7",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
78,404,MJ Leach,lbw,,7,1,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-404,"75.5 England all out? Leach reviews. Ashwin comes over the stumps this time, and gets something to happen first ball. Fullish on off, and angling in. Leach has bat and pad together, but the ball has hit the pad first before hitting the blade. Ball tracking says hitting in front of middle, and crashing into middle and leg. England all out for 205 205/10",,,Ashwin
78,405,Z Crawley,caught,AM Rahane,5,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-405,"4.4 edged and pouched at first slip by Rahane! After beating Crawley with a big-turning offbreak, Ashwin makes the incision with a non-turner. Full and pushed through around off stump, the new ball slides on this time. Ashwin tricks Crawley into playing for turn, snags the outside edge, and over to Rahane 10/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
78,406,JM Bairstow,caught,RG Sharma,0,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-406,"4.5 Two in two for Ashwin as YJB prods it straight into the lap of leg slip. Tossed up on middle, Ashwin gives this more air and finds turn. Bairstow hangs back in the crease, closes his bat-face, aiming for the glance, and pops it up to Rohit. Motera celebrates with Ashwin and Rohit. YJB bags another duck 10/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
78,407,JE Root,lbw,,30,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-407,"25.1 right back on the stumps, thumped on the pads, Root is lbw! He's reviewed straightaway, as well he might. Is there inside edge? Nope, I don't think so ...and that's going to be smashing middle and off, surely.... three red lights and that is England toasted, buttered and ready for the application of cream and jam. 65/6",,,Ashwin
78,408,MJ Leach,caught,AM Rahane,2,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-408,"54.2 a soft-handed snaffle from Rahane, and there goes another! The TV umpires are checking, but the soft signal is out. Another ripper across the left-hander's bows, this time it kisses the splice as it passes, and with fingers splayed at slip, Rahane scoops up his second, inches from the turf 134/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
78,409,DW Lawrence,bowled,,50,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,04-Mar-21,Test # 2414,ashwin-wkt-409,"54.5 a big wipe through the line, and Ashwin seals it with a five-for! Lawrence going for his century of runs for the match, aims a flat-footed mow, chooses the wrong line, and gets his bails trimmed. An inelegant finish, but he's shown his ticker. But this is India's moment now. A 3-1 win, and they are off to the World Test Championship final in June. 135/10",,,Ashwin
79,410,TWM Latham,caught,V Kohli,30,2,v New Zealand,Southampton,England,18-Jun-21,Test # 2425,ashwin-wkt-410,"34.2 gone, and as is so often the case, Ashwin gives India their breakthrough! Latham reaches out to drive a flighted ball outside off, and he's beaten in the air by either a change of pace or by dip or by both. Ends up scooping it in the air, and short extra-cover takes a sharp catch over his head. Kohli had to jump and grab it at full stretch 70/1",,InField,Ashwin
79,411,N Wagner,caught,AM Rahane,0,2,v New Zealand,Southampton,England,18-Jun-21,Test # 2425,ashwin-wkt-411,"96.3 taken at the second attempt at slip! Turn from an off-stump line and it zips off the shoulder of the bat, Rahane could only palm it up initially, but then settled safely under it on the way down. Ashwin pockets a second, job almost done for India 234/9",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
79,412,TWM Latham,stumped,RR Pant,9,4,v New Zealand,Southampton,England,18-Jun-21,Test # 2425,ashwin-wkt-412,13.3 there's the big wicket. That should reinvigorate India. Lathn goes down the pitch to hoick it to the leg side but is beaten both in the air and off the pitch and Pant does the rest. 33/1,,,Ashwin
79,413,DP Conway,lbw,,19,4,v New Zealand,Southampton,England,18-Jun-21,Test # 2425,ashwin-wkt-413,"17.2 big appeal and given! No hesitation this time from Michael Gough. Conway has a chat with Williamson, seems to indicate he didn't get any bat. Williamson says don't bother. Good call, because that seemed plumb. Ashwin gets this to curve in and skid straight through to beat the inside edge and hit him plumb in front of middle. Has Ashwin cracked open this game or what? 44/2",,,Ashwin
80,414,WA Young,caught,KS Bharat (sub),89,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-414,"66.1 was there an edge? Given not out but Bharat is confident. Ashwin nods too and India have gone for the review. A fuller length ball outside off, Young tried to dab it behind point but the ball kept low and took an outside edge. The credit should go to Bharat too as he stayed low and pouched it easily 151/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
80,415,KA Jamieson,caught,AR Patel,23,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-415,"138.6 Jamieson's patience finally runs out! Delightful bit of deception from Ashwin. Hangs it up above his eyeline, outside off. Jamieson goes for the hoick across the line. He probably wants to go down the ground, but finds the ball isn't quite there. Ends up skewing it towards deep mid-wicket. Axar Patel is the fielder in place to pouch an easy catch 284/9",,Outfield,Ashwin
80,416,WER Somerville,bowled,,6,2,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-416,"142.3 that's the end of the innings! Another one for Ashwin, and due reward too. Goes for the sweep, across the line. Pitching around off and going on with the arm. Goes under his bat, and strikes the off stump midway through 296/10",,,Ashwin
80,417,WA Young,lbw,,2,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-417,"2.6 this has kept low, and struck him on the pads. Looks to be heading down the leg side, and he has reviewed right as the clock runs out! He has to go, though. The replay will be interesting. It's a fullish length ball, and has gone past his inside edge as he shapes to defend. Goes along the ground. It is missing, for sure, but they took too much time to ponder over what to do! Desperately unlucky Will Young 3/1",,,Ashwin
80,418,TWM Latham,bowled,,52,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-418,"54.2 slowness of the wicket gets him. Short of length, wide outside off, Latham looks to force it through covers but gets an inside edge onto the stumps. With that wicket, Ashwin has gone past Harbhajan Singh's Test tally of 417. Here's the list of the highest wicket-takers in Test cricket 118/3",,,Ashwin
80,419,TA Blundell,bowled,,2,4,v New Zealand,Kanpur,India,25-Nov-21,Test # 2435,ashwin-wkt-419,"78.2 got him, that's a hugely unusual dismissal! Stretches out to defend one turning in from outside off, and he ends up going too far across with his front leg, maybe, ends up exposing his stumps behind him. Hits the inside half of the bat, rolls past his left leg, and then hits leg stump. It may have hit the bat, then hit a footmark, and then bounced backwards 138/7",,,Ashwin
81,420,HM Nicholls,bowled,,7,2,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-420,"13.1 Ashwin bursts through the defences of the left-hander immediately. Nice and full from Ashwin, this angles in from round the stumps, as opposed to turning away from Nicholls who did not read it and played for the turn instead. Beaten in length too as the ball dips and bowled through the gate. NZ slump to 31 for 5 31/5",,,Ashwin
81,421,TA Blundell,caught,CA Pujara,8,2,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-421,"19.4 Smart catch from Pujara at leg slip. Another beautiful offbreak from Ashwin. On a fuller side of a good length, starts outside off and turns in towards leg stump, Blundell shuffles across and looks to defend, but the ball pops off an inside edge. It threatens to die down, but Pujara dives low to his right and snaffles it at leg slip 53/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
81,422,TG Southee,caught,SA Yadav (sub),0,2,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-422,"19.6 Ashwin strikes again. NZ eight down and sinking. Tossed up, spins in from outside off, finishes on middle. Southee has a short stride and offers a bat-pad catch to Surya who is subbing for Gill 53/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
81,423,WER Somerville,caught,Mohammed Siraj,0,2,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-423,"27.5 Somerville's resistance ends. He couldn't rein himself in enough to not go for that shot. Looks to swat across the line but the ball is on a good length and it's turning in too, can't get hold of it at all and it just plops to mid-on for the simplest of catches 62/9",,InField,Ashwin
81,424,TWM Latham,lbw,,6,4,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-424,"3.6 slides in with the arm and the lbw appeal is upheld. But Latham reviews after a brief chat with Young. I don't think that ball is doing enough to miss the stumps. Bowled on a length and comes with the angle, Latham on the front foot, defending down the wrong line because he thought it would turn. Hits him flush on the pad. Three reds on the review and Latham has to go. Takes a review with him. 13/1",,,Ashwin
81,425,WA Young,caught,SA Yadav (sub),20,4,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-425,"14.3 Caught at short leg? Umpire Anil Choudhary isn't interested, so Kohli calls for a review. Offbreak from Ashwin, sharp turn and even sharper bounce. Starts outside off and veers in, Young inside-edges it onto his front pad, the ball lobs to Surya, the sub, at short leg. Young goes for 20. The on-field not-out call is reversed by TV umpire VK Sharma 45/2",,Close-in,Ashwin
81,426,LRPL Taylor,caught,CA Pujara,6,4,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-426,"16.1 Taylor holes out off Ashwin. He went for every ball. He goes for this too. Full, tossed up outside off, he fetches a slog-sweep and skies it. Pujara runs back and across to his right from leg slip and settles under it 55/3",,Close-in,Ashwin
81,427,HM Nicholls,stumped,WP Saha,44,4,v New Zealand,Wankhede,India,03-Dec-21,Test # 2438,ashwin-wkt-427,"56.3 that's the end of that! Saha's brilliance and Nicholls' rush of blood combine to close the series down. Beautifully tossed up on middle, Nicholls is enticed by the flight, perhaps is mindful of getting a few runs because he only has Ajaz for company, but chooses the wrong ball to hit out. Because this one grips the surface and rips away sharply even as he advances, and by the time he swings through, he has missed it completely as the agile Saha completes a smart stumping. India take the series 1-0. New Zealand have unravelled very, very quickly on the fourth morning. 167/10",,,Ashwin
82,428,K Rabada,caught,Mohammed Shami,0,4,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,26-Dec-21,Test # 2443,ashwin-wkt-428,"67.5 tossed up, slower through the air, shorter in length as well. Rabada once again goes for the drive. Once again he gets the outside edge and this time it loops to the backward point fielder 191/9",,InField,Ashwin
82,429,L Ngidi,caught,CA Pujara,0,4,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,26-Dec-21,Test # 2443,ashwin-wkt-429,"67.6 and it's all over. Tossed up around off, spinning in. Ngidi pushes at it, gets an inside edge and Pujara accepts it gleefully at leg slip. (And no, Ashwin will not be on a hat-trick in the next Test) 191/10",,Close-in,Ashwin
83,430,KD Petersen,lbw,,28,4,v South Africa,Johannesburg,South Africa,03-Jan-22,Test # 2445,ashwin-wkt-430,"27.2 given lbw. But South Africa will have to review it. No, they don't. It looked like it spun sharply. Was a length ball, just outside off and spinning big. Petersen looks to flick it away but misses and is struck in front of middle and leg. The umpire took his time before raising the finger. Was it spinning down? Or maybe just clipping? Probably the latter. Scratch that, replays show that was hitting leg 93/2",,,Ashwin
85,431,HDRL Thirimanne,lbw,,17,2,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-431,18.2 Ashwin traps him lbw. Thirimanne ponders before sending it upstairs. Was a length ball around off that kept sliding in with the arm. Thirimanne was playing for the turn and gets beaten on the inside edge. The impact was in front of off and the ball would have gone on to hit middle. Sri Lanka lose their first wicket and the first review 48/1,,,Ashwin
85,432,DM de Silva,lbw,,1,2,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-432,"38.1 massive premeditated sweep, and he has missed a full straight delivery. Given out, and he is not reviewing it. It is really full, has pitched just outside off, doesn't have the opportunity to turn past the stumps because of the full length. Plumb in front. Another premeditated sweep to the first ball of a new spell from a spinner 103/4",,,Ashwin
85,433,HDRL Thirimanne,caught,RG Sharma,0,3,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-433,"2.3 a superb catch by Rohit, going low to his right at second slip. Tossed up around off, Thirimanne comes forward to defend but the ball spins away to take the outside edge and Rohit does the rest 9/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
85,434,P Nissanka,caught,RR Pant,6,3,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-434,"6.5 top, top over, and Ashwin has reviewed this after his caught-behind appeal is turned down. Every ball of this over has been an offbreak, and all of them have turned from a perfect length outside off stump, but the degrees of turn have varied. This one doesn't turn too much, and Nissanka, stretching out to defend, gets a feather of an outside edge - which Snicko reveals - through to Pant. Outstanding bowling. When the degree of turn can't be predicted, and the length is so good, the batter is more or less reduced to predicting and hoping 19/2",,Keeper,Ashwin
85,435,KIC Asalanka,caught,V Kohli,20,3,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-435,"35.3 another leftie in the bag, a trademark dismissal, and Ashwin has now gone past the one and only Kapil Dev Nikhanj. Beautiful flight close to off stump, then the dip and the turn, and Asalanka, stretching out to defend, outside-edges into Rishabh Pant's pads, and the ball bounces up to an alert Virat Kohli at slip. the ball drifted in initially, and opened up the left-hander ever so slightly 121/5",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
85,436,CBRLS Kumara,caught,Mohammed Shami,4,3,v Sri Lanka,Mohali,India,04-Mar-22,Test # 2452,ashwin-wkt-436,"59.6 India seal the game. No ten-for for Jadeja. Tossed up on middle and off. Kumara once again goes aerial but hardly any power behind it. Shami, who is halfway to long-off boundary, runs to his right and takes it comfortably 178/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
86,437,RAS Lakmal,bowled,,5,2,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-437,"33.6 Ashwin gets into the wickets column. It's a carrom ball. Fuller on middle and leg, Lakmal has no idea which way it's going to turn. He looks to hit it down the ground but it spins big to beat the bat and rattle the stumps 100/8",,,Ashwin
86,438,MVT Fernando,stumped,RR Pant,8,2,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-438,35.5 another carrom ball. This time shorter around off. Fernando lunges forward and pushes at it. He is playing for an offbreak but the ball spins like a legbreak to beat him by quiet some distance. Pant was quick to dislodge the bails. The third umpire finds the foot was in the air 109/10,,,Ashwin
86,439,BKG Mendis,stumped,RR Pant,54,4,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-439,"19.4 lovely bowling. Beaten in the flight as Mendis jumps out of the crease. It dips on him and Mendis is nowhere near the pitch of the ball. So he has to go to plan B, which is to defend, well in front of his body. This is where there is a puff of dust, and the ball doesn't turn at all. Beaten on the outside edge, and Pant does the rest. Ashwin level with Dale Steyn on 439 wickets 97/2",,,Ashwin
86,440,DM de Silva,caught,GH Vihari,4,4,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-440,"27.5 Ashwin goes past Dale Steyn! Classic bat-pad dismissal on a pitch of this kind. Ashwin stays round the wicket and flights this well above his eyeline. DDS looks to come forward to defend, but ends up defending with bat away from body. Takes take the inside edge, and cushions off the front pad. Vihari at short leg dives to his left, with both hands ahead of him, and completes the catch 105/4",,Close-in,Ashwin
86,441,L Embuldeniya,lbw,,2,4,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-441,"57.3 Ashwin gets this one to straighten, and it strikes Embuldeniya as he presses forward. Appeal for leg before, but not given, but India review. Does look adjacent, unless the height comes to the batter's rescue. Not, it is clipping the top of leg. Ashwin gets another one! 206/8",,,Ashwin
86,442,MVT Fernando,caught,Mohammed Shami,2,4,v Sri Lanka,Bengaluru,India,12-Mar-22,Test # 2456,ashwin-wkt-442,"59.3 swipes across the line, and Shami at mid-off completes the catch! Tossed up nicely way outside off, and he takes the bait to go across the line, but ends up top-edging. Tucks his bat under his armpit immediately, knowing that it would take an ourtrageous error from the fielder to give him a reprieve. That isn't forthcoming, and India take the series 2-0 208/10",,InField,Ashwin
87,443,Zakir Hasan,caught,V Kohli,100,4,v Bangladesh,Chattogram,Bangladesh,14-Dec-22,Test # 2481,ashwin-wkt-443,"78.2 Ashwin and his mates are celebrating, Zakir is walking back, but the umpire seems unsure of what has happened there. Ah, replays show there was inside edge, as Zakir went to defend this full and loopy ball dipping on middle and off. His bat was on off stump, as the ball ballooned off his pad towards first slip, where Kohli dived forward to complete a good low catch. A brilliantly-compiled innings comes to an end for Bangladesh 208/4",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
88,444,Najmul Hossain Shanto,lbw,,24,1,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-444,"15.2 LBW given, Bangladesh review. No shot offered to a length ball pitching just outside off. Looked to have spun away just a bit which might work for Shanto but it only needs to clip. Just clipping it is! A cheer from the Indians as Shanto leaves. It hit him just below the knee roll, straightened a bit but Hawk-Eye predicted that it would go on to kiss the outer-half of the off stump. Shanto whacks his pad on his way back. India back in the contest now. 39/2",,,Ashwin
88,445,Litton Das,caught,KL Rahul,25,1,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-445,"48.5 Soft dismissal as Litton chips it to midwicket. Ashwin tosses it up on a full length at the stumps, Litton flicked it and got it in the air. Popped to Rahul, who was close enough to catch that at a comfortable height. A good innings and partnership comes to an end. 172/5",,InField,Ashwin
88,446,Mominul Haque,caught,RR Pant,84,1,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-446,"73.3 Appeal for caught behind, given. Mominul walks. A weird dismissal as the ball brushed the glove as Mominul looked to leave the ball after reaching out for the flashy drive. It was a length ball that was given ample air. Ashwin pulling his length back ensured Mominul didn't go after chasing it. He decided to leave, but was a bit too late at the end. The gloves were just outside the line of the stumps, the carrom ball came in and just took the glove on the way. 227/9",,Keeper,Ashwin
88,447,Khaled Ahmed,caught,JD Unadkat,0,1,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-447,"73.5 Low full toss is whacked to deep midwicket, Unadkat dives and takes it well. Bangladesh end on 227. It was slow and dipping, there for the shot. Khaled went after it but it didn't sail. 227/10",,Outfield,Ashwin
88,448,Najmul Hossain Shanto,lbw,,5,3,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-448,"7.6 A bigger LBW appeal, it's given. Batters discuss and take the review on the last second! It was a length ball that pitched around off, Shanto looked to defend it with a close-faced bat (arc going around from slip to mid-on). No edge, Hawk-Eye shows three reds. Ashwin is congratulated by team-mates as the batter walks back. The ball skidded off the pitch, looked to have come in with the angle, Shanto was on the back foot and got pinned. 13/1",,,Ashwin
88,449,Taijul Islam,lbw,,1,3,v Bangladesh,Mirpur,Bangladesh,22-Dec-22,Test # 2484,ashwin-wkt-449,"67.1 Given out LBW, reviewed quickly by Taijul. Taijul looked to push the ball straight, beat the inside edge and hit him high on the knee roll of the front pad. It was a length ball that was pitching on off (in line), impact is in line. It's clipping leg stump. Taijul has to depart. 220/9",,,Ashwin
89,450,AT Carey,bowled,,36,1,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-450,"53.1 cleaned up on the sweep! Live by the sword and die by it. Ashwin gets No. 450. Round the wicket, full at middle and leg, Carey goes for the reverse sweep, takes the bottom edge and dribbles into the stumps. He's actually a touch unlucky in a way 162/6",Yes,,Ashwin
89,451,PJ Cummins,caught,V Kohli,6,1,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-451,"57.3 edged, taken this time! Talking of Kohli's slip catching. This was a nice one. Good height. Cummins pushed outside off, this one goes straight on, taken at around knee height. Would have been an inquest if that had gone down 172/7",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
89,452,SM Boland,bowled,,1,1,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-452,"63.5 carrom ball. Like a cat playing with a mouse he has beaten him outside off with offbreak, and now bowls the full and straight carrom ball to beat his outside edge comprehensively and knocks back the off stump 177/10",,,Ashwin
89,453,UT Khawaja,caught,V Kohli,5,3,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-453,"1.5 it takes just five balls. Tosses it up for the drive again, but gets the drop this time. Enough time for it to turn and take the outside edge on the drive. Kohli takes the catch at slip 7/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
89,454,DA Warner,lbw,,10,3,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-454,"13.5 that is plumb. An Ashwin special. Warner has reviewed it. This is meant to be an offbreak with the seam pointing towards gully, but it pitches on off, and keeps going on with a puff of dust. The inside edge is beaten, and there is an umpire's call on the leg stump. Australia retain the review, but Australia are three down 34/3",,,Ashwin
89,455,MT Renshaw,lbw,,2,3,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-455,"15.2 again caught back to a fullish ball. Given. Renshaw has reviewed the lbw call. This is the parallel-seam delivery, which can go straight or turn away depending on which part of the ball it lands on. This one lands on the seam, turns away, beats the outside edge, lands on off, hits him in front of off and is hitting top of off. Australia lose the review too 42/4",,,Ashwin
89,456,PSP Handscomb,lbw,,6,3,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-456,"17.2 spins back from round the wicket and takes the front pad, appeal for lbw and they go for the review!. Oh, this will be close. Hits the knee roll around middle stump. Three reds! Hitting the top of leg stump. Super review and the collapse continues. Lovely bowling from Ashwin 52/5",,,Ashwin
89,457,AT Carey,lbw,,10,3,v Australia,Nagpur,India,09-Feb-23,Test # 2490,ashwin-wkt-457,"19.2 misses this reverse sweep and is given lbw! The carnage continues. Carey sweeping everything. He goes for the review, although a rather forlorn look on Carey's face. Strikes low down on the pad. Can't see this missing. Middle halfway up. Six down 64/6",,,Ashwin
90,458,M Labuschagne,lbw,,18,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-458,"22.4 big appeal for lbw! Did this come back enough? They call for the review. Labuschagne was playing forward. Oh, this looks very good. No bat and this is in front of middle and off. Impact in line with off stump and hitting the middle of middle 91/2",,,Ashwin
90,459,SPD Smith,caught,KS Bharat,0,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-459,"22.6 edged, taken behind! And how the game changes. As we know it can. Pushed across wider outside off, great variation and skill, Smith lunges forward and can only get a thin nick. Neat take from Bharat 91/3",,Keeper,Ashwin
90,460,AT Carey,caught,V Kohli,0,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-460,"46.6 edged, taken at slip! Not much Carey could do about that. Angled in from round the wicket, bounced and straightened, takes the shoulder of that, a fast edge that was well held 168/6",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
90,461,TM Head,caught,KS Bharat,43,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-461,"12.6 edged, caught behind! Ashwin strikes early. Lovely delivery. Grips from around off stump, brings Head forward, shaves the outside edge into the keeper's gloves 65/2",,Keeper,Ashwin
90,462,SPD Smith,lbw,,9,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-462,"18.6 huge appeal and given lbw! This looks good for Ashwin. Smith misses his sweep and calls the review. Only impact can save him. Well, it has turned a lot. Maybe going down leg? Certainly struck in line. Umpire's call on leg stump! 85/3",,,Ashwin
90,463,MT Renshaw,lbw,,2,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,17-Feb-23,Test # 2493,ashwin-wkt-463,22.6 another sweep and another lbw! Another talk between the batters and Renshaw reviews. Looked good live. Hits low down on the front pad. Not bat involved. Did get a good stride in...but it's smashing middle half way up 95/5,,,Ashwin
91,464,PSP Handscomb,caught,SS Iyer,19,2,v Australia,Indore,India,01-Mar-23,Test # 2496,ashwin-wkt-464,"70.6 big wicket that will get India going. Sharp catch at short leg by Shreyas Iyer. Ashwin tosses this up nicely on middle and leg, it draws Handscomb forward but beats him with the dip and spin to take the inside edge to bring the close-in fielder into the picture. Iyer stayed nice and low to take it right on his midriff. 186/5",,Close-in,Ashwin
91,465,AT Carey,lbw,,3,2,v Australia,Indore,India,01-Mar-23,Test # 2496,ashwin-wkt-465,"74.1 struck on the pad from around the stumps and Nitin Menon says, 'on ya bike, mate.' Carey says 'no yet' and signals for a review. Absolutely no bat involved. That much is sure. Carey lunged forward but played down the wrong line to be beaten on the inside edge, ball tracking confirms this would have crashed into leg stump. Carey has to make the long walk back. What a spell of play for India post drinks. 196/8",,,Ashwin
91,466,NM Lyon,bowled,,5,2,v Australia,Indore,India,01-Mar-23,Test # 2496,ashwin-wkt-466,"76.3 bowled him! Lyon sees this tossed up and goes for that slog sweep, misses it altogether and the stumps are smashed. Ashwin ends with three wickets as Australia have been bundled out in quick time after an excellent first hour of play. They've lost their last six wickets for just 12. 197/10",,,Ashwin
91,467,UT Khawaja,caught,KS Bharat,0,4,v Australia,Indore,India,01-Mar-23,Test # 2496,ashwin-wkt-467,0.2 a wicket off the second ball. Much closer to the off stump this time and a touch fuller. Khawaja comes forward to defend and gets a faint outside edge. A vociferous appeal from Indians and up goes the finger. Khawaja looks confused and opts to review it. And there's a spike on UltraEdge. Australia 0 for 1 0/1,,Keeper,Ashwin
92,468,TM Head,caught,RA Jadeja,32,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-468,"15.3 finds mid-on! A wicket for India just after drinks. Head looks to keep attacking, but this time ends up gifting a catch low to Jadeja's left. He skips down the pitch to this full and tossed up ball, which is bowled outside off. There is hardly any pace to work with there, as he lofts but off the toe-end of the bat. No timing in that shot, as the slowness of the pitch comes into play 61/1",,InField,Ashwin
92,469,C Green,caught,KS Bharat,114,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-469,"130.2 caught down the leg side trying to sweep! Good catch. Green sucked into Ashwin's plan to frustrate him. Floated down leg with a lot of protection and the leg slip, he got down on one knee to sweep, a shot he has not played at all, gets a little tickle off the glove and Bharat takes a very good catch having moved well. 378/5",,Keeper,Ashwin
92,470,AT Carey,caught,AR Patel,0,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-470,"130.6 A horror shot! Skews off the outside edge to short third man! Tossed high and wide of off, Carey tries to launch on the up over mid off from the crease, gets a thick outside edge that floats high to short third and Axar strolls around the take the catch. That is not good cricket from Carey. 378/6",,InField,Ashwin
92,471,MA Starc,caught,SS Iyer,6,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-471,"135.3 gone, tickled to short leg! Ashwin has all three of the wickets to fall today. After bowling short and quicker last delivery, he slowed it down considerably and also went much fuller. It pitched round about off stump, as Starc took a good stride forward to defend, but the ball was angled in from around the wicket. It took the inside edge, and went right in Iyer's lap 387/7",,Close-in,Ashwin
92,472,T Murphy,lbw,,41,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-472,"165.3 again hits him in front, and this is given leg before after a confident appeal by Ashwin. But as expected, Murphy reviews. Ah, replays show it actually hit his back leg. Ashwin bowled one with a horizontal seam, pitching it on a length just around off stump. And while the replay is shown, Murphy is already halfway back to the dressing room. He had tried to defend but missed, with the ball sneaking in the gap between bat and pad, as he was beaten on the inside edge. The impact is in line, and it is umpire's call on clipping the side of leg stump. So Ashwin has a five-for 479/9",,,Ashwin
92,473,NM Lyon,caught,V Kohli,34,1,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-473,"167.2 outside edge, popped to slip off Bharat's pads! Ashwin again bowled with a horizontal seam, pitching it fullish and just around off stump. It straightened after pitching, as Lyon defended but got an outside edge. The ball ballooned to Kohli's right, as he bagged an easy catch to wrap things up 480/10",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
92,474,MP Kuhnemann,lbw,,6,3,v Australia,Ahmedabad,India,09-Mar-23,Test # 2499,ashwin-wkt-474,"10.4 And the finger goes up! Kuhnemann goes to Head to discuss a possible review, but he's been sent back by the more senior cricketer. This was full landing on off and sliding into middle. Kuhnemann defends down the wrong line, ball hits his pad. That's missing leg stump, according to replays! Initially seemed like it was hitting the stumps but the ball slid down too much. 14/1",,,Ashwin
93,475,T Chanderpaul,bowled,,12,1,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-475,"12.5 oh magic ball. Reminds me of Ashwin to Cook at Edgbaston where again Ashwin was introduced first change. Goes really wide on the crease, angles this in, pitches middle and off, has Chanderpaul worried about the angle and then turns it only slightly to beat the outside edge and hit the top of off. This is all the magic of the angle, which has Chanderpaul worried about the lbw should the ball not turn. Beautiful bowling. Also he has now got both the Chanderpauls out in Test cricket 31/1",,,Ashwin
93,476,KC Brathwaite,caught,RG Sharma,20,1,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-476,16.3 he's thrown his wicket away - really. Full ball around off. Brathwaite takes a big stride in and looks to club it over midwicket. But it's not full enough and Brathwaite slices the shot. High up and Rohit at cover calls early for this one 38/2,,InField,Ashwin
93,477,AS Joseph,caught,JD Unadkat,4,1,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-477,"52.4 that's a third for Ashwin. Flat but full around off. Joseph goes for the glory shot, a slog over the leg side but the leading edge takes the ball off-side instead. Unadkat at backward point with a simple one to deal with. Replay confirms that was the carrom ball. Joseph played it expecting the off-break but the ball was turning the other way. Just beautiful. Einstein of offspin 124/7",,InField,Ashwin
93,478,A Athanaze,caught,SN Thakur,47,1,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-478,"54.6 out for 47! The dream of a fifty on his debut Test innings will not be. Ashwin realised Athanaze is not quick enough to go onto the back foot. Atleast felt like that in the previous delivery, and on this occasion, Athanaze falls victim. This was shorter from Ashwin, with some decent bounce. Athanaze tried to pull it in front of square, over midwicket, but the ball goes up instead. Shardul with another catch and Ashwin now has four 129/8",,InField,Ashwin
93,479,JA Warrican,caught,Shubman Gill,1,1,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-479,"64.3 has it carried to short leg?. Again he is hurried into playing this. This slow length ball turns it sharply, Warrican, looking to leave it, now throws his hands at it, gloves it onto the pad, and lobs it up towards short leg. Gill has to dive full length, and three different angles confirm he has his fingers under the ball. Given out. Five-for for Ashwin. No. 33 in Test cricket 150/10",,Close-in,Ashwin
93,480,KC Brathwaite,caught,AM Rahane,7,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-480,"16.5 change in angle has worked almost right away! Fullish ball lands on middle from around the stumps. Brathwaite goes on the back foot to defend, but the ball has straightened after pitching and taken the outside edge to first slip. He wasn't sure whether the ball would turn in or go away with the bowler's angle, and pays the price by keeping his bat dangling somewhere in between. 22/2",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
93,481,J Blackwood,lbw,,5,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-481,"20.3 huge shout, given out lbw, and Blackwood has reviewed it. Ashwin slows it down, flights it, pitches it full and outside off. Blackwood goes to defend, but it turns big with a puff of dust and hits him below the knee roll. Ball tracking shows it is hitting the leg stump. Ashwin has two 32/3",,,Ashwin
93,482,A Athanaze,caught,YBK Jaiswal,28,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-482,"36.2 Jaiswal makes up for the earlier drop with a special low catch at short leg. Lovely bowling first of all. Such nice drift into the pads that he has Athanaze playing down the wrong line. It takes the inside edge because it doesn't turn, and goes quickly and low to short leg, but Jaiswal is alert and takes it 78/6",,Close-in,Ashwin
93,483,AS Joseph,caught,Shubman Gill,13,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-483,"42.3 one slog too many! Gill at deep midwicket takes a simple one. Ashwin around the stumps, gets a full ball around off to turn in sharply. Joseph's slog sweep is sliced, and this doesn't have the legs to clear the boundary. 100/7",,Outfield,Ashwin
93,484,RRS Cornwall,caught,Shubman Gill,4,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-484,"46.1 an eighth ten-wicket haul for R Ashwin! Standard offbreak, landing outside off, turning in sharply. Cornwall's attempted defense takes the inside edge, hits the knee-flap, and lobs up for Gill at short leg, who jumps up in excitement to gobble it up. He also moves level with Anil Kumble with eight 10-fors. Herath, Hadlee, Warne and Murali ahead of him. 108/8",,Close-in,Ashwin
93,485,KAJ Roach,bowled,,0,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-485,"46.4 half a dozen! No. 6 for Ashwin. Full ball outside off. Roach tries to defend but the ball whizzes through the gap between his bat and body. Off-stump rattled, and India are one wicket away. 108/9",,,Ashwin
93,486,JA Warrican,lbw,,18,3,v West Indies,Roseau,West Indies,12-Jul-23,Test # 2510,ashwin-wkt-486,"50.3 reverse sweep... misses, hits the pad... appeal, given! Of course there's a review. Fullish ball landing on middle and straightening. Goes under the bat as he misses the sweep. No glove involved either. Three reds.... Ashwin gets a seventh.... India win by an innings and 141 runs! Ashwin's best overseas figures, finishing with 7 for 71. 130/10",,,Ashwin
94,487,KC Brathwaite,bowled,,75,2,v West Indies,Port of Spain,West Indies,20-Jul-23,Test # 2513,ashwin-wkt-487,"72.4 what a beauty. Ashwin has been trying to do this for a while. This is a special special wicket because there has been nothing in this pitch. Lovely late drift, drawing him away to defend, and this time it hits that one small rough patch and spins back in through the gate to hit the middle stump. Lovely bowling. Been working up to this for tens of minutes 157/3",,,Ashwin
94,488,KC Brathwaite,caught,JD Unadkat,28,4,v West Indies,Port of Spain,West Indies,20-Jul-23,Test # 2513,ashwin-wkt-488,"17.6 top-edged to short fine leg! Brathwaite is gone trying to sweep after the same shot in the previous ball didn't work out. Looking for the scoring option by seeing the man fairly close in, he saw a tossed-up ball which was dipping on to middle and off. That pitched full and hinted to turn in, as Brathwaite's attempted sweep only got a top edge. Simple catch with a reverse cup for Unadkat 38/1",,InField,Ashwin
94,489,KSA McKenzie,lbw,,0,4,v West Indies,Port of Spain,West Indies,20-Jul-23,Test # 2513,ashwin-wkt-489,"19.6 Kishan sounds very confident, and McKenzie is given leg before wicket. He thinks about a review, but walks back in the end. Immediately after Ashwin changes the angle, he is rewarded with a wicket. He slanted one full while angling it into the left-hander - looked like the front-of-the-hand release - while also bowling quicker and flatter. The ball was full on middle, and went on straightishly to beat his defence. West Indies lose two to Ashwin in a hurry 44/2",,,Ashwin
95,490,G Coetzee,caught,Mohammed Siraj,19,2,v South Africa,Centurion,South Africa,26-Dec-23,Test # 2520,ashwin-wkt-490,"99.1 he has picked out Siraj at mid-off. Coetzee had decided he'll be ultra-aggressive, couldn't hold back the moment he saw this tossed up. First wicket for Ashwin; happens to be wicket number 490. 391/7",,InField,Ashwin
96,491,BM Duckett,lbw,,35,1,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-491,"11.5 there's the first for India and it's No. 491 for Ashwin! Duckett plays for turn when there's none, this skids through to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. Umpire Chris Gaffaney is dead certain that was hitting the stumps, Duckett isn't quite sure so he opts for DRS. All it needed was for the ball to clip the stumps, which it does and DRS comes back as umpire's call. Duckett has to go back. 55/1",,,Ashwin
96,492,Z Crawley,caught,Mohammed Siraj,20,1,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-492,"15.1 drilled straight to mid-off! Crawley looks to be assertive but gifts Ashwin a second - although again they are checking for the catch. The ball was dying on Siraj, but it looks like he managed to get fingers under it as he stooped and tumbled over to his right. Given! England have lost 3 for 5 in five overs. Bazball took the tourists galloping through the first 45 mins but they've hit their first hurdle 60/3",,InField,Ashwin
96,493,MA Wood,bowled,,11,1,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-493,"61.3 knocks him over! Ashwin drifts one fuller and across Wood who goes for an expansive slog sweep, but misses it altogether as he's way too early into the shot. The off stump is flattened. 234/9",,,Ashwin
96,494,Z Crawley,caught,RG Sharma,31,3,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-494,"9.2 gone this time! Ashwin's utter mastery of angles prises the opening! Back around the wicket, pitch-perfect on off stump, a fraction slower and dipping on Crawley's defensive push. Kisses the edge and hops into the hands of slip! It was a fine statement from Crawley, but it's ended by an even better bit of bowling 45/1",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
96,495,BA Stokes,bowled,,6,3,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-495,"36.5 stunning bowling from Ashwin! That's the 12th time he's got Stokes, and it's one of the best balls yet. So full, flighted, dripping with guile, dips, grips, turns past a resolute block and plucks out the off stump! It's a killer blow for England, as India close in now! 163/5",,,Ashwin
96,496,TW Hartley,bowled,,34,3,v England,Hyderabad,India,25-Jan-24,Test # 2525,ashwin-wkt-496,"100.1 bowled him with a shooter! Not sure that sight will be overly comforting to India, but Hartley has to depart... Ashwin hits his length and Hartley perhaps shouldn't be playing back. But the ball straightens and rockets along at shin height to pluck off stump from the ground. Ends a superb stand of 80 for the eighth wicket 419/8",,,Ashwin
97,497,BM Duckett,caught,KS Bharat,28,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Feb-24,Test # 2526,ashwin-wkt-497,"10.5 brilliantly done by the keeper! Ashwin with the breakthrough in his first over. Clear inside edge on to the pads but the ball balloons away into the leg side, Bharat has to motor off and put in the full-length dive. Up goes the finger, up go the noise levels. Ashwin gets No. 497, Duckett in his pocket once again 50/1",,Keeper,Ashwin
97,498,OJ Pope,caught,RG Sharma,23,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Feb-24,Test # 2526,ashwin-wkt-498,"28.2 Ashwin gets in. Lovely catch to his left by Rohit. Or rather it has stuck in his mitt. Pope is caught playing back to a ball not short enough. No turn there, extra bounce, takes the edge, Rohit reacts reflexively and it gets lodged in his left hand. No. 498 for Ashwin 132/3",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
97,499,JE Root,caught,AR Patel,16,4,v England,Visakhapatnam,India,02-Feb-24,Test # 2526,ashwin-wkt-499,"30.6 Root throws the bat again, gone this time! An ugly hoick and the end of a frenetic innings. He had clearly set out to play in an aggressive mode - whether that's because he was bothered by his finger injury we don't know - but he was nowhere near this, aiming a slog over midwicket and the ball ballooning up to backward point 154/4",,InField,Ashwin
98,500,Z Crawley,caught,RM Patidar,15,2,v England,Rajkot,India,15-Feb-24,Test # 2530,ashwin-wkt-500,"13.1 Ashwin has his 500th Test wicket! He's all smiles as team-mates gather around him. Not his best ball but he has bowled to his field and landed it in the rough. Dravid and Co applaud. Team-mates are hugging him, he raises his hand to acknowledge the crowd, some of whom are dancing in the aisles. It's down leg on a full length, Crawley tries to sweep it fine and over the infield. Gets a top edge and Patidar takes a dolly. 89/1",Yes,InField,Ashwin
98,501,TW Hartley,bowled,,16,4,v England,Rajkot,India,15-Feb-24,Test # 2530,ashwin-wkt-501,"36.1 dragged on, Ashwin strikes! Lobbed up outside off, Hartley throws the bat but only succeeds in sending an inside edge cannoning into the stumps. Test wicket No.501 for Ashwin, and his 250th left-hander 91/9",,,Ashwin
99,502,JM Bairstow,lbw,,38,1,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-502,"21.2 big appeal, YJB hit on the back leg sweeping! Not given by Rod Tucker but Rohit reviews. Looked pretty adjacent on first glance. Did he hit it? No, says UltraEdge. Pitching on leg, straightening enough from round the wicket. This is going to be overturned! Thumping into middle and off stumps, three reds. Ashwin gets amongst 'em in his second over 109/4",,,Ashwin
99,503,BM Duckett,caught,SN Khan,15,3,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-503,"4.5 Ashwin is on the board. Duckett will be disappointed he has got out playing a nothing defensive shot. A typical Ashwin dismissal. On a length, drifting in, making him play around the front pad. The ball doesn't turn, goes off the inner edge to short leg 19/1",,Close-in,Ashwin
99,504,OJ Pope,lbw,,0,3,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-504,"4.6 it is two in two. Dharamsena has raised his finger. Pope has reviewed. Parallel seam again, Pope goes back to play for an offbreak, the ball doesn't turn as much, beats his outside edge, hits his back pad in front of leg. Ball tracking returns umpire's call on leg stump. Pope has to go. A pair for him. Ashwin will be on a hat-trick next over 19/2",,,Ashwin
99,505,JE Root,lbw,,11,3,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-505,"16.6 huge lbw shout as he has missed a full and straight delivery. Not given, and India have reviewed. Has he got some bat on this? Full, middle and leg, beats the inside edge, hits him low in front of middle and leg. UntraEdge confirms no edge. Pitches leg, hits leg. India have one oveturned. Ashwin jumps for joy. India stay alive just as it was slipping away. This is the first ball that has turned in a while, and has thus beaten his inside edge 65/3",,,Ashwin
99,506,BT Foakes,caught,R Ashwin,17,3,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-506,"53.2 gottim, chipped straight back! Foakes' tortoise race is run, failing to pick the carrom ball as he works across the line. Flicked out beautifully and it spins away to take the leading edge, a simple catch for the bowler. Ashwin does the job for his captain and we are almost at the endgame 145/9",,Return catch,Ashwin
99,507,JM Anderson,caught,DC Jurel,0,3,v England,Ranchi,India,23-Feb-24,Test # 2531,ashwin-wkt-507,"53.5 goes for the reverse-sweep, Jurel snaffles the ball! Not quite sure how it ended up in his gloves but Rod Tucker's finger goes up. England are cooked for less than 150, and India's target will be 192 to claim the match and the series. This was great work from the keeper, as the ball ricocheted off Anderson's hip and then the back of the bat - a reaction grab with one hand to finish things for India. Ashwin walks off with a five-for, too 145/10",,Keeper,Ashwin
100,508,TW Hartley,caught,D Padikkal,6,1,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-508,"49.2 goes for the slog-sweep... but holes out! Hartley won't be hitting Ashwin for six No. 5 in the series, although he's not all that far off. Well taken just in from the rope by the debutant Padikkal. Ashwin has the first wicket of his 100th Test 183/7",,Outfield,Ashwin
100,509,MA Wood,caught,RG Sharma,0,1,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-509,"49.4 edged to slip, another one gone! Bounce more than turn does the job for Ashwin this time. Hits high up the bat with Wood attempting to defend, can only manage to lob an outside edge into Rohit Sharma's bread basket. Two in three balls for Ashwin 183/8",,Slip-cordon,Ashwin
100,510,BT Foakes,bowled,,24,1,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-510,"57.1 the overspin has bowled him. Foakes has got himself outside the line of off on the sweep, but the ball hits the pad and then arm and then spins on to the wicket. There's nothing he can do from that position on a knee 218/9",,,Ashwin
100,511,JM Anderson,caught,D Padikkal,0,1,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-511,"57.4 now tries the big sweep, and can't clear midwicket. Ashwin walks away with four in his 100th Test. Sometimes you get them wickets without working very hard for them 218/10",,InField,Ashwin
100,512,BM Duckett,bowled,,2,3,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-512,"1.5 this wicket has been brought about by his inability to trust his defence. The last ball popped up. So Duckett feels he is better off attacking. He charges at him, is beaten in the air, and toes the ball on to the off stump. Actually he has completely missed it 2/1",,,Ashwin
100,513,Z Crawley,caught,SN Khan,0,3,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-513,5.3 and that backward short leg gets one in the basket. Ashwin turns it in from a good length and just outside off. Crawley has lost his balance because of the dip. He is playing well in front of his body. And closes the face on top of it. A rare failure for Crawley this series 21/2,,Close-in,Ashwin
100,514,OJ Pope,caught,YBK Jaiswal,19,3,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-514,"9.2 Pope sweeps, spoons a top edge... done for! Another frenetic innings comes to a messy close, and so ends Ollie Pope's tour. The bounce does for him, a wild shot ballooning towards square leg where Jaiswal jogs up to take the catch. Third for Ashwin, who's enjoying his 100th Test 36/3",,InField,Ashwin
100,515,BA Stokes,bowled,,2,3,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-515,"22.5 bowled' im! Ashwin gets Stokes again, 13th time in Tests. Fourth of the innings, eighth of the match for Ashwin, playing his 100th Test. Does him with the arm ball, Stokes not sure which edge to cover and beaten on the inside, hits the top of off. India crowding through the door here 103/5",,,Ashwin
100,516,BT Foakes,bowled,,8,3,v England,Dharamsala,India,07-Mar-24,Test # 2534,ashwin-wkt-516,"26.4 five-for in his 100th Test for Ashwin. An uncharacteristic hoick from Foakes. That just about tells you the fight has left England. Lovely drift and dip, Foakes tries the big slog sweep and is beaten comprehensively. Bowled'im. Ashwin's family on their feet as he holds the ball aloft 113/6",,,Ashwin
