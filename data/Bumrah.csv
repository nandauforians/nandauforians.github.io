1,1,AB de Villiers,bowled,,65,1,v South Africa,Cape Town,South Africa,05-Jan-18,Test # 2292,bumrah-wkt-1,"32.6 goes through him! 140 kph, massive wicket. Bumrah's maiden Test wicket is de Villiers. Full delivery outside off, de Villiers drives but that seam movement again, takes the inside edge and hits off stump. Throws his head back as he heard the stumps disturbed. 126/4",,,"1.

Absolutely unplayable to be honest. Good length at 141ks, bursts off the pitch, and angling into Faf. He presses forward thinking it's a simple length ball but is surprised by the extra bounce and loosens his grip but the ball catches the top glove and flies through to Saha. What a brute of a ball from a Test debutant and a man playing his first first-class match after a year. #ScenesinNewlands 82/5",,Keeper,"2. F du Plessis WP Saha b Bumrah

Saha moves to his right and grabs it in front of his head. Top catch. Ultra Edge detects a spike. Umpire Kettleborough has to reverse his on-field not-out decision. De Kock has to go, and Kohli is pumped. Back of a length, starts outside off, and seams back in sharply. The batsman pushes outside the line and inside-edges it behind 92/6",,Keeper,"3.

Bumrah has destroyed that tenet of Test batting for now. Back of a length ball coming in at middle stump. He's looking to flick on the up, but the bat is about 3 inches above the ball, which has hit him on the knee roll 3/2",,,"6. HM Amla lbw Bumrah

He stands and stares at the pitch, perhaps wondering why it hasn't made the ball bounce over the wickets. But Bumrah, when he pitches it up, gets balls to skid through and there's that exaggerated angle into the right-hander as well. 107/5",,,"8. F du Plessis b Bumrah

De Kock goes for the on-the-up drive and presents a big gap between bat and pad.

After being beaten; tested on the inside and outside edges, he hits it perfectly off the sweet spot. A very full ball on leg stump - the kind he makes disappear - ends up in the hands of deep square leg. India celebrate. They still have a slight lead. And the last specialist batsman is gone. What an innings though from the Mighty mighty Hash. That little change to his technique; the bravery to do so on viciously tough conditions and the aptitude to not just survive but thrive. 169/7",,Outfield,"10. HM Amla HH Pandya b Bumrah

3,13,AB de Villiers,caught,AM Rahane,6,4,v South Africa,Johannesburg,South Africa,24-Jan-18,Test # 2294,bumrah-wkt-13,"55.6 taken at gully. India are back. A back of a length delivery kicks up a bit more than de Villiers thinks, it also straightens enough to snatch the edge right off the shoulder of the bat and settle safely in Rahane's hands. This X-factor is why India persisted with Bumrah on this tour and despite looking their weakest bowler in this innings, he has dismissed one of the world's best batsmen 131/3",,close-in,"13.

Very little de Kock can do when a 139 kph delivery, pitching short, comes in at the height of the knee-roll. He can't adjust to the ball that quick, doing that much.

Instinctive jab and his decision to withdraw the bat comes too late. It's kissed the edge and flown wide to Pant's left. He's skipped across comfortably and taken his second Test catch. It's almost a repeat of India's innings from yesterday. India have gained the momentum now. 54/2,,Keeper,"15. KK Jennings RR Pant b Bumrah

This is a thick edge, with Root pushing hard at a shortish delivery, wide enough to be left alone, but Bumrah's angle lures Root into playing. It always lures right-handers into playing. The outside edge flies to Rahul's right. It's nearly past him as he thrusts out both of his hands, eyes on the ball all the way, and takes it like an absolute boss. Splendid work!

It's very full. It's always heading towards the stumps. Very very strange that he'd leave this ball. Pins him on the knee roll. And ball-tracking says it would clip middle stump. Umpire's call - and Gaffaney had said it was out. So Buttler has to go. India find the wicket they've been looking for all afternoon and the Trent Bridge crowd rises as one to applaud a fine cricketer who might just have fallen in love with Test cricket all over again 231/5,,,"18.

Bairstow might have been at his absolute best and he wouldn't have been able to do anything against this peach. It angles into the right-hander, lulling him into thinking he would have to block around middle and leg. Then it pitches and holds its line. Such trickery, Such devious glorious trickery.

He's in a monster mood and he's showing off. Woakes has an issue with the short ball. He fell to one in the first innings. And this time he's faced with the same old scary thing. Except this is quicker. And it's coming right for his head. He doesn't have time to get out of the way. He tries to fend. He tries so hard.

Pitches the new ball up, on middle, has the left-hander squared up because of the angle. Broad has to defend. The ball takes the outside edge. Rahul is waiting at second slip. How many catches does he have now? Seven, I hear. Meanwhile, Bumrah's leading India towards a dominant Test win, and along the way, he puts his finger on his lips looking at a part of the crowd that is screaming no-ball 291/9",,slip-cordon,"21.

I think it only just pitched in line with leg stump, then shot through at knee height and Jennings simply padded up! A complete brain freeze, and Jennings' miserable series continues... Straightening off the pitch, hitting the top of middle stump, Bumrah strikes! 1/1",,,"22. KK Jennings lbw Bumrah

He makes it so hard when he gets the occasional one to straighten away from the right-hander - as he's done here. His usual angle is so pronounced, into the batsman, that he almost always has to play at it, especially when it's so close to his off stump. Not so much Bairstow did wrong, defending off the back foot and pretty close to his body, but all he manages is a tickle through to the keeper 28/3",,Keeper,"23. JM Bairstow RR Pant b Bumrah

Rahul has to go through a nervous moment, grabbing at the ball as it evades his first grab. But the second third is solid. Cook walks with his team still trailing. Oh, he was desperate for runs, and this is the worst ball when in that mindset. It's full. It's wide. It's ripe for the drive. The left-hander goes for it and just a hint of nip away off the pitch ensures it's the edge that connects and not the middle 24/1",,slip-cordon,"25. AN Cook KL Rahul b Bumrah

There is a disappointed sigh at The Oval but then the crowd rises for Cook as he goes off after playing one on for 71. This is on a length, just outside off, possible with the switched seam position to send it back in. Cook is surprised by the movement back in, and gets the inside edge as he looks to defend 133/2",,,"26. AN Cook b Bumrah

This is full, and looks pretty adjacent. Not sure why it took Wilson that long to give it. Root falls over playing an inswinger, also plays across the line, not showing it the full face of the bat. The ball hits him in front of off, and would have hit leg. The replay confirms that, and England lose a review. Pretty ordinary review again. India right back in this 133/3",,,"27. JE Root lbw Bumrah

This is on a length, outside off, seams back in as opposed to swinging. Goes past the inside edge, hits him low on pad. The review shows firstly that Bumrah has made the adjustment with the front foot and is nowhere near flirting with the no-ball. The projection shows it is clipping leg, and the decision stays, but England don't lose the review 214/8",,,"28. AU Rashid lbw Bumrah

First wicket for Bumrah and Handscomb has thrown it away after doing all the hard work.

He didn't offer a shot to a huge inswinger and was given by Nigel Llong. It hit the back leg outside the line but no shot means it still can be out. Ball tracking says ... hitting. Out!

Perfect length, angled in forcing Marsh to defend from the crease, it just nipped away a touch, he just got the faintest of edges pushing at it, and it goes through to Pant! He's given out.

They won't bother reviewing this lbw, he's been struck on the full, right in front of middle stump. World class from Bumrah. Quick-arm whippy action, Marsh has been dealing with those yorkers solidly so far, but he's early on this because he's rolled his fingers over it and got it to dip. Can't play that, it's just too good. Marsh can't believe it. He was looking good and seemed to have taken them to some sort of safety, only to be outdone by a moment of genius. He's dejected, but there's really no way to adjust when you're hurrying down to deal with a yorker and it ends up drifting in slowly. The perfect deception. 89/4",Yes,,"41. SE Marsh lbw Bumrah

Sibley, playing all around his front pad, is struck low, and the only doubt there can be is whether it might miss leg stump. There's no inside edge. Bam.

Nothing Root could do about it, and India's celebrations are muted because, though it's a big wicket, the ball kept low, and that's not a good sign going into the fourth innings. Back of a length, sneaks through low to strike Root's back leg at about shin height as he looks to defend this, right in line with off stump. Okay, maybe it didn't keep that low.

On the fuller side of a length, pitching in line with leg stump or maybe just outside, and straightening in to beat the inside edge as Burns defends without a big stride forward. It's pitched just in line with leg stump, and Hawkeye has it clipping the top of middle stump, so Burns will have to walk back. Bumrah's struck in the first over of the series!
