Jadeja pushed through a regulation delivery that didn't turn, went on with the arm and Trott simply allowed it through, bat pointed at the sky, just a tickle of off stump but that's all it takes and Jadeja has his first wicket in Test cricket!. 102/3 ",,,"1.

Flat, shortish, Cowan goes to cut, but the ball skids on, takes a healthy edge, which hits Dhoni's pad just above the knee roll, the plateauish region from where it bounces to slip where Sehwag is alert. Cowan doesn't look pleased. Is he just disappointed or did he want the umpires to take a look at the replay to see if it bounced off the ground?

Warner wants to leave the crease in defence, but for some reason restrains his forward movement.

In the midst of all that, Jadeja has taken five.
