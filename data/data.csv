1,1,DM Bravo,bowled,,12,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-1,"Ashwin strikes timber for his first wicket in Tests. Quick offbreak, angled in from round the stumps, hurries off the turf and straightens down the line. Should Bravo have been on the front foot? He stays back and tries to cut though there is no room to work with. He misses and the stumps are in a mess. That was a really poor shot, he was cutting from the leg stump line! 72/3"
1,2,MN Samuels,caught,MS Dhoni,15,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-2," and he's nailed him with a slider. The last one too held its line, and this wasn't a bad ploy at all to a batsman who stays back and tries to read the spin off the pitch. This one was full, Samuels didn't have much time to realise it was holding its line and poked at it with hard hands. The ball took a thin edge, Dhoni completed his 200th dismissal, and Ashwin's second. Huge blow this, Samuels is as key to the WI cause as Chanders. 200/5"
1,3,R Rampaul,lbw,,12,1,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-3,"and yet another leg before, Ashwin started to appeal a touch late, slowly at first, but his appeal gained confidence as it grew longer, he had struck Rampaul with a quickish one that hurried in, Rampaul was pushing well outside the line even as it struck him in front of middle 304/9"
1,4,KOA Powell,caught,G Gambhir,0,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-4,"1.4 caught at short cover! Powell went forward and reached for the ball away from his body, playing the cover drive. He couldn't keep it along the ground but hit it hard straight at Gambhir. He didn't catch it on the first attempt and the ball bounced off his hands in front of him. He didn't catch it on the second try either, but grasped it with his left hand on the third while diving forward 0/1"
1,5,DM Bravo,lbw,,12,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-5,"29.2 Ashwin gets Bravo again, a tactic that Harbhajan uses so well against the left-handers in Tests, tossed up from round the stumps, dragging him forward in defence, he pushes outside the line for the turn, there isn't much and he is rapped on the pad, will have to wait for the replays, looked in line with the stumps in real time, umpire Tucker thought so too, replays show that struck him in line with off, fine decision 63/5"
1,6,MN Samuels,bowled,,0,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-6,"29.6 the carrom ball strikes now, outstanding control he has over this ball, flighted slowly on the off stump line, again drawing another batsman forward, he pushes inside the line this time and well within the pads, the ball goes away from him, and takes out off stump, the game turns after this double-wicket maiden 63/6"
1,7,S Chanderpaul,lbw,,47,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-7,"45.6 Ashwin has got the big wicket, he had been bowling over the stumps to Chanders while going round the stumps to Darren Bravo, pitched it around leg and got it to turn across Chanders who pushed at it bat and pad together, the ball found the pad and umpire Tucker sent Chanders back 124/8"
1,8,DJG Sammy,bowled,,42,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-8,"51.5 five-for on debut for R Ashwin, he has gone through Sammy with a carrom ball that hardly got up, Sammy was on the back foot and that allowed him no time to get his bat down as it skidded and took off 157/9"
1,9,R Rampaul,caught,PP Ojha,18,3,v West Indies,Delhi,India,06-Nov-11,Test # 2015,ashwin-wkt-9,"57.3 Ashwin has his sixth wicket, Rampaul falls on his favoured slog sweep, the ball was a touch too full, he went ahead with the shot, Ojha was placed some way in from the deep midwicket boundary and took it easily 180/10"
2,10,KC Brathwaite,caught,G Gambhir,17,2,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-10,"11.1 caught at bat pad! Brathwaite came forward to defend but was beaten by the flight, the ball spun into him and lobbed off the pad to Gambhir, who had an easy catch to take. Did that hit the bat, though? I'll need to see a replay. Don't think there was an edge 30/2"
2,11,S Chanderpaul,lbw,,4,2,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-11,18.3 lbw! Huge wicket for India. There's no doubt about this one. Chanderpaul moved right across his stumps and missed the straighter one because he was playing across the line. He was caught on the crease right in front. That would have hit middle and leg. 46/4
2,12,MN Samuels,lbw,,84,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-12,"117.5 Ashwin has struck, West Indies' last specialist batsman is gone, Samuels was caught on the back foot by a length delivery, that pitched outside off and struck him on the back leg as the ball tuns past his bat, his bat actually hit the flap of his back pad, so it came down slower than expected, the ball hits him in front of off, it was plumb! and an early finish looms now 417/7"
2,13,KAJ Roach,bowled,,1,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,14-Nov-11,Test # 2017,ashwin-wkt-13,"121.4 where did that come from, Ashwin gets the length ball to drift away before barrelling back in, through the gate and crashes into the top of off and middle, superb delivery, too good for Roach, and this match is quickly winding down 421/8"
3,14,AB Barath,caught,MS Dhoni,62,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-14,"52.5 there's the wicket. The batsmen's concentration hasn't been spot on for the last 15 minutes. Barath presses half forward, and then stays there - neither forward nor back - to a length-ball offbreak. The ball turns and bounces, gets the inside edge onto the pad, and lobs up for an easy catch for Dhoni 137/1"
3,15,KC Brathwaite,caught,V Kohli,68,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-15,"58.6 Ashwin strikes again. Bat-pad again. Again the well-set batsman. KB is not too pleased with the decision. This one dips on Brathwaite, who is found not to the pitch of the ball. The ball turns, seemingly past the inside edge, and lobs off the pad. Indians have no doubt there is bat involved, the umpire has no doubt bat is involved. KB is not convinced, though. It has kissed the glove on the way. Entirely possible that KB didn't feel it. Top call by the ump 150/2"
3,16,R Rampaul,caught,V Kohli,10,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-16,"174.1 A straighter one from round the stumps. RR defends for an offbreak, is hit on the pad, and then bat, and taken at silly point. Ashwin starts appealing for leg-before first, which is a very good shout too. The umpire, though, gives him out caught. Two distinct sounds there 563/8"
3,17,MN Samuels,caught,R Dravid,61,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-17,"176.6 Carrom ball. Gone. Dravid takes a good, low catch. Just short of a length, Samuels moves forward to play for an offbreak, then sees it break away a touch, and instinctively opens the face. The edge is taken, and the low chance is pouched at slip 566/9"
3,18,D Bishoo,bowled,,12,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-18,"184.1 That's a Michelle. Ashwin's second five-for in three Tests. Bishoo tries to slog a full ball, this is an arm ball - full and quick, and takes out the off stump 590/10"
3,19,CS Baugh,bowled,,1,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-19,"47.5 Ojha can't get the perfect 10, but I am sure he won't mind it. The classical offspinner's dismissal. Tossed up outside off, not sure if it drifted away, but Baugh went to drive against the turn and away from the body. The gate was created, and the offbreak burst through. West Indies are having a public nervous breakdown here 117/6"
3,20,KOA Powell,lbw,,11,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-20,"49.3 Huge wicket. Last recognised batsman gone. Bold decision from the umpire. Powell strides forward, this is a length ball, pitches just outside off, goes with the arm. Powell plays for the turn. beaten. The height looks good but it has some distance to travel. Would have clipped leg, but these are the decisions we see given more often these days. The first lbw of the match if I am not mistaken 120/7"
3,21,DJG Sammy,caught,MS Dhoni,10,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-21,"57.1 Sammy is gone. West Indies go deeper into the mire. Short of a length, outside off, open of-side field. Sammy rocks back to force it through the off side. Gets a thick edge, and Dhoni takes a good catch. West Indies 242 for 9, with 66.5 overs to go, minus two for the changeover 134/9"
3,22,D Bishoo,lbw,,0,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,22-Nov-11,Test # 2019,ashwin-wkt-22,"57.2 He spends precisely a minute on the wicket. That's eight wickets in 95 minutes. All ten to spinners. Shambolic from West Indies. Ashwin bowls the arm ball first up, pitches outside off, short of a length, keeps going from outside off. Hit in front of the stumps, no the back foot. Easy lbw decision 134/10"
4,23,EJM Cowan,caught,MS Dhoni,68,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-23,"67.1 Ashwin has a wicket. Cowan's supreme vigil comes to an end, and Australia are slipping down a familiar slope now. Cowan's been eager to cut Ashwin all day, and hasn't quite figured his drift and variety. This one again, was much too close to the body to cut, but he went for it, and thick-edged it into Dhoni's gloves. Very good take, that. Definite sound, but was there an edge? Oh dear ... Cowan didn't look happy with the decision. HotSpot didn't light up. 214/6"
4,24,BW Hilfenhaus,caught,V Kohli,19,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-24,"105.4 didn't take long for Ashwin to tempt Hilfy and send him on his way. Tossed up invitingly outside off, it wobbled over the eye line, came down gently and was asking to be muscled across the line. Hilfenhaus obliged, dragging it from wide of off stump towards long-on. It barely travelled three-fourths of the way to the boundary, and Kohli settles under it easily. 318/9"
4,25,NM Lyon,bowled,,6,1,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-25,"109.6 Ashwin's bowled Lyon round the legs and Australia are bowled out. Quite a strange dismissal. It was fired in full on off stump, Lyon got drastically across and looked to sweep. He missed, and Ashwin pegged back off stump. All out for 333, triple Nelson ends the innings. 333/10"
4,26,NM Lyon,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Melbourne,Australia,26-Dec-11,Test # 2025,ashwin-wkt-26,"53.6 Ashwin has struck, umpire Erasmus thinks that is going to hit leg stump, it was the flighted carrom ball, pitched on a length, Lyon was playing off the back foot and was caught on the pad, have to wait for replays to see if it was taking leg, yes, replays show Erasmus was spot-on 166/8"
6,27,SE Marsh,bowled,,3,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-27,"9.6 bowled him! The pressure mounts on Marsh after another failure. Ashwin gave the ball some air and pitched it on a good length just outside off. Marsh moved forward to defend but left a large gap between bat and front pad as he did so. He played down the wrong line, for the ball went on with the arm, through the gap, and hit the stumps. 31/2"
6,28,EJM Cowan,caught,VVS Laxman,30,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-28,"25.5 caught at cover! Ashwin tossed this ball up outside off stump, drawing Cowan forward and into the cover drive. The ball dipped and Cowan didn't get to the pitch of it, hitting it hard, flat and low towards the right of the fielder at short cover. VVS Laxman was the man in that position and he did superbly to dive low to hold the chance with both hands. Not bad for a supposedly old man! 84/3"
6,29,PM Siddle,caught,WP Saha,2,1,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-29,"139.6 Ashwin strikes with the carrom ball, thin edge through to Saha as Siddle pushes forward 533/7"
6,30,DA Warner,caught,R Ashwin,28,3,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-30,"9.6 Ashwin strikes, he has troubled both openers, Warner looks to work a full delivery on the leg side, but ends up chipping it down the track, Ashwin moves towards Cowan and takes a neat low catch 39/1"
6,31,EJM Cowan,lbw,,10,3,v Australia,Adelaide,Australia,24-Jan-12,Test # 2031,ashwin-wkt-31,"11.4 that has got to be out, Cowan shuffling again way across, looking to work on the leg side, it carries in with the angle and hits him in front of middle, plumb, that was hitting leg 40/3"
7,32,MJ Guptill,caught,V Kohli,2,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-32,"10.1 the bowling changes sure are paying off! And Ashwin's got the in-form Guptill, tossed up on middle and leg, Guptill was forward to defend, inside edge brushes the pad and goes to Kohli at backward short leg 29/2"
7,33,LRPL Taylor,caught,V Kohli,2,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-33,"12.5 Appeal for a catch at backward short leg! It's Kohli again. The ball turned and Taylor was trying to tuck it away to the leg side, there was certainly bat on it and all the Indians were confident it was taken cleanly, the umpires are checking, the third umpire has to study a few replays, not very straightforward I can assure you, and he has given it out. It took a few replays. It appeared as if Kohli had his fingers underneath it all along 35/3"
7,34,DR Flynn,lbw,,16,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-34,"18.1 NZ slip further against the spinners! Flynn was looking positive and had employed the sweep with some success against Ojah, he tried the same against Ashwin, tried to sweep him from the off stump from round the wicket, the umpire reckoned that hadn't spun enough and hence was hitting off stump, he was struck on the base of the pad 55/4"
7,35,JS Patel,caught,R Ashwin,10,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-35,"57.3 appeal for a caught and bowled! Patel's sticking around because it was a very low catch to his left on the dive, it was bowled a touch wide outside off and Patel reached out for an expansive off drive, ended up spooning it to Ashwin's left, he just managed to get his fingers underneath it, the umpires consulted and the third umpire looked at a few replays, clean catch in the end 153/8"
7,36,TA Boult,caught,G Gambhir,4,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-36,"61.2 Ashwin takes five! Bat-pad catch, tossed up on middle stump, Boult tries to work it away past the packed cordon on the on side, inside edge to the pads and Gambhir plucks it at forward short leg 159/9"
7,37,CS Martin,bowled,,0,2,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-37,"61.3 well that was quick, that's a six-for for Ashwin and at the stroke of lunch, bowls it a touch flatter on the off stump, Martin was prodding forward and never looked like getting his bat behind the line, spun back in and hits his stumps 159/10"
7,38,LRPL Taylor,bowled,,7,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-38,"48.3 New Zealand in big trouble now, no DRS doubts over this one, Taylor makes a poor poor decision to leave a delivery from Ashwin, it spins in sharply and takes the top of the off stump, not a replay Taylor will want to see, Ashwin gave that one plenty of air, and got the ball to rip off the track 105/3"
7,39,DR Flynn,lbw,,11,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-39,"67.2 Flynn goes for the sweep, Flynn gone lbw, no doubts about that one, flighted and that one sneaks under Flynn's bat, hit low on the pad in front of middle and off, Ashwin knew that was gone even as he started to appeal, the umpire agrees, India five wickets away now 142/5"
7,40,JEC Franklin,caught,V Sehwag,5,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-40,"69.6 sensational catch from Sehwag, terrific delivery from Ashwin to start with, that spun away after drifting in, plenty of bounce as well, too good for Franklin, who nibbles it through, a faint edge past Dhoni, Sehwag launches himself to the right to pluck a low one-handed effort 145/6"
7,41,CFK van Wyk,lbw,,13,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-41,"77.2 ten in the game for Ashwin, he loves his home Tests, the carrom ball from Ashwin foxes van Wyk, who went for the reverse-sweep, a shot he used extensively against Narine in the Caribbean, he misses and is struck on the thigh pad, he's gone lbw 160/8"
7,42,TA Boult,caught,V Sehwag,0,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-42,"79.2 Ashwin finding it all too easy here, Sehwag making slip catching looking easy here as well, he had a shocking time at slip in the recent Sri Lanka series, Ashwin sends in a topspinner, Boult plays down the wrong line, edges it through to slip, Sehwag has to bend low to his right to collect that, makes it seem casual. 138 for 3 to 164 for 9 164/9"
7,43,CS Martin,lbw,,0,3,v New Zealand,Hyderabad,India,23-Aug-12,Test # 2054,ashwin-wkt-43,"79.5 it's all over, Martin's legendary batting record continues, a pair for him, Ashwin gets his second six-for of the match, this one struck Martin low on the pads in front of the stumps, not too much doubt there, the carrom ball struck him on the back leg, in front of middle and off, a comprehensive win sealed for India 164/10"
8,44,DR Flynn,lbw,,33,1,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-44,"42.2 and he's fallen for the third time this series to the sweep, and to Ashwin, tossed up offbreak. Flynn wants to sweep, misses, the ball straightens on middle and off, and strikes him on the thigh pad, looked like hitting off, credit to Ashwin for flighting the ball 196/4"
8,45,KS Williamson,caught,V Sehwag,13,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-45,"17.6 Ashwin strikes in his first over, tossed up fullish, turns in a bit, KW pushes forward inside the line, and the edge travels to Sehwag at slip 69/3"
8,46,DR Flynn,caught,V Sehwag,31,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-46,"40.5 that has been guided straight to Sehwag at first slip, Flynn on the front foot initially as Ashwin tosses it up just outside off, good length, straightens and bounces, he tries to steer it belatedly and finds Sehwag 140/5"
8,47,CFK van Wyk,lbw,,31,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-47,"55.4 Ashwin has got him this time, bending and pushing half-forward, tossed up ball delivered from close to the stumps, sneaks in past bat and hits pad in front of middle and leg, gone 195/6"
8,48,JEC Franklin,stumped,MS Dhoni,41,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-48,"61.5 Ashwin gets another one, Franklin has charged out to a flighted ball, had a swing, been beaten by the sharp turn and bounce, and Dhoni has done the rest 216/7"
8,49,TG Southee,bowled,,2,3,v New Zealand,Bengaluru,India,31-Aug-12,Test # 2055,ashwin-wkt-49,"65.6 another Test five-for for Ashwin, flights it high and full, Southee goes for a big drive, the ball spins in and strikes the top of middle and leg 222/8"
9,50,NRD Compton,bowled,,9,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-50,"13.3 gone! There's the first one. A lovely delivery, spins from outside off and turns through the gap between bat and pad into middle stump. Compton didn't quite cover for the spin, but it was a marvelous delivery. The first of many like that, you suspect 26/1"
9,51,IJL Trott,caught,CA Pujara,0,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-51,"15.3 and another! Turning into a late-day procession here. Nicely flighted, turns just enough to take the inside edge into the pad and another catch to short leg 30/3"
9,52,AN Cook,caught,V Sehwag,41,2,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-52,"39.4 Gone. Bring on the follow-on. Nicely bowled too. Tossed up on off, much slower than usual, makes his drive, and for a change Cook is not right to the pitch of the ball. The offbreak produces the edge, and Sehwag pouches a sharp low catch. Cook fought hard, concentrated intensely, but is gone now 80/6"
9,53,GP Swann,bowled,,17,3,v England,Ahmedabad,India,15-Nov-12,Test # 2058,ashwin-wkt-53,"153.5 one adventurous shot too many. Swann walks down the wicket, reverses his stance, and tries the switch hit. Ashwin keeps his head, fires it in full and straight, and the middle stump is flattened. England effectively 76 for 9 406/9"
10,54,AN Cook,caught,MS Dhoni,122,2,v England,Wankhede,India,23-Nov-12,Test # 2062,ashwin-wkt-54,"86.6 really well bowled. One of the rare Ashwin overs with no short balls, and he has got the wicket. Flighted, just short of a driving length, Cook defends without reaching its pitch, and the ball turns away to take a thin edge, Punched by Dhoni. A relieved smile on Ashwin's face. His second wicket in his last 85.2 overs. Good to see Kohli pat Cook on his back as he walks back 274/3"
10,55,MS Panesar,caught,Z Khan,4,2,v England,Wankhede,India,23-Nov-12,Test # 2062,ashwin-wkt-55,"121.3 oh dear Monty! Goes for the sweep again, he connected well but Dhoni had just moved a man to deep midwicket. Did Paneasr see him? Anyway, it was a simple catch. 413/10"
11,56,KP Pietersen,lbw,,54,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-56,"143.2 goes again, this is straighter, misses and given out lbw. Looked pretty straight and Ashwin finally strikes. Sweeping those straight balls, you have to hit them and Pietersen simply didn't, was caught in line with middle stump and that almost certainly wasn't doing too much to go down leg 420/5"
11,57,JM Anderson,caught,V Sehwag,9,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-57,"167.2 turn, bounce, and a very good low catch by Sehwag. Short of a driving length, Anderson doesn't come forward, the ball turns appreciably, hits the edge, and Sehwag takes a low catch to his right. All bowlers have takes a wicket off their second ball of the day today 523/9"
11,58,MS Panesar,lbw,,0,2,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-58,"167.3 Ashwin will be on a hat-trick if England are required to bat again. Panesar has been suitably angered before he comes to bowl. He has been given out lbw off a thick inside edge. Full ball, middle and off, hits the edge, then the pad, but Dharmasena raises his finger 523/10"
11,59,AN Cook,stumped,MS Dhoni,1,4,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-59,"0.5 Ashwin gets a wicket too. Cook wants to finish it off in a hurry, jumps out of the crease, the ball is tossed up slightly wide, he can't reach it, is beaten by the turn, and is stumped. Only the second time he has been stumped in his career. Finally he took it easy then 4/1"
11,60,KP Pietersen,caught,MS Dhoni,0,4,v England,Eden Gardens,India,05-Dec-12,Test # 2065,ashwin-wkt-60,"4.2 Oh boy. There are things happening here. Is Eden up to its magic? Lovely catch by Dhoni. It is game on here. Offbreak, turning in, Pietersen defends, the ball doesn't turn as much as he expects it to, and the outside edge settles inside Dhoni's gloves 8/3"
12,61,MJ Prior,bowled,,57,1,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-61,"114.6 bowled'im. Timber. Well bowled Ashwin. An over full of flighted deliveries, bringing the batsman forward all the time. That's the best chance you have on this pitch. Tossed up on of middle and off, Prior plays for the turn, the ball doesn't turn, and knocks back the off stump. Ashwin is pumped 242/6"
12,62,AN Cook,caught,MS Dhoni,13,3,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-62,"29.5 makes him play this time, big appeal for caught behind and given out the finger goes up straight away but the immediate replay suggests Cook may be unlucky again. He was drawn forward just outside off stump, there was a little turn that look it away from Cook, there was a sound which drew the appeal, it was a straightforward take for Dhoni and the umpire nodded and raised his finger instantly. In fact the replay suggests that Cook missed it by a long distance, another very poor decision from Dharmasena 48/1"
12,63,IJL Trott,caught,V Kohli,143,3,v England,Nagpur,India,13-Dec-12,Test # 2066,ashwin-wkt-63,"134.1 leg stump, flicked at and it's off the face to leg slip, a wicket! And India finally remove Trott getting him to flirt at a full delivery from around the wicket into the rough outside leg stump and he got a good load of bat on it put straight to Kohli who held a solid chance at chest height with two hands 302/4"
13,64,EJM Cowan,stumped,MS Dhoni,29,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-64,"14.3 Ashwin gets the wicket finally. Cowan is gone. Lovely dismissal on all counts. Tossed up, dips on him, Cowan wants to hit another six, not near the ball at all. The ball turns and bounces, Dhoni collects it in front of his chest, and nonchalantly stumps him 64/1"
13,65,PJ Hughes,bowled,,6,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-65,"18.3 bowled'im. Ashwin gets another. Hughes has played on. This is short, turning away giving him the room, but he doesn't play the proper cut. Just pushes at it with his arms, and gets an inside edge onto the leg stump. Had he played the proper full-blooded cut, he would have got four for this. Ashwin won't mind it, though. He has bowled some superb deliveries earlier, which have not got him wickets 72/2"
13,66,SR Watson,lbw,,28,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-66,"34.4 and Ashwin strikes soon after lunch. Done in by the low bounce. Short of a length, outside off, he is going back but this skids through. It would have hit the stumps for sure, but might or might not have hit him just outside the line of off. The replays are not entirely conclusive, but it looks more outside the line than in 126/3"
13,67,DA Warner,lbw,,59,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-67,"36.4 Warner has played with fire far too often and for far too long. Continues staying back to fullish deliveries. He has been misjudging the length too often to have carried on with this innings. Goes back deep into the crease. The trajectory is flat all right, but the length is much fuller. He is late in bringing the bat down, and is caught dead in front 131/4"
13,68,MS Wade,lbw,,12,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-68,"46.6 all five for Ashwin so far. Tossed up on middle and leg, straightens after that. Wade plays down the wrong line altogether, and is hit in front. That's pretty adjacent, although Wade doesn't seem happy when walking back 153/5"
13,69,MC Henriques,lbw,,68,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-69,"89.2 Ashwin has six out of six. Henriques out sweeping. This is a big offbreak, has beaten the bat, and seems to have hit him in front of off. Was it turning too far? I thought so, but on replays this looks closer 304/6"
13,70,NM Lyon,caught,V Kohli,3,1,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-70,"132.6 finally Dharmasena raises his finger. Don't think he was left with an option. Offbreak, middle and leg, swept away, gets an edge fine, and Kohli takes a superb catch to his right at backward short leg. Ashwin's best figures in first-class cricket 380/10"
13,71,SR Watson,caught,V Sehwag,17,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-71,"15.6 Ashwin gets Watson with the last ball before lunch. The crowd erupts too. This is what offspinners should be bowling on this pitch. Flighted, slower through the air, wider outside off, and then it dips. Watson, who wants to play a forward-defensive, discovers he is not close to the pitch of the ball, and the ball turns and bounces to go off the glove or the shoulder of the bat for an easy catch to slip 34/1"
13,72,EJM Cowan,lbw,,32,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-72,"28.6 Dharmasena's finger finally goes up, and it is a superb call again. Cowan is disappointed with the call because presumably he thinks he has been given out caught bat-pad, but he is out lbw here. This i what happened: quick deliver, pitched middle, straightened, and hit him in front of middle. In between, Cowan's bat hit the boot, and Vijay went up for the catch too. However, officially he has been given out lbw, and it looks pretty straight on that count. In fact the only thing that could have saved him was an edge, and he would have been out in that case too 64/2"
13,73,MJ Clarke,lbw,,31,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-73,"49.3 Huge wicket of Clarke arrives. It took a really naughty trick from the pitch to get him. Flighted but short, Clarke goes back to cut, but it spins sharply and stays low, and hits his back pad just in front of off. Was it spinning too much? I doubt. For he is on the back foot and there isn't a long way to go 131/6"
13,74,JL Pattinson,caught,V Sehwag,11,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-74,"63.1 Sehwag takes a low catch for a change. Ashwin goes over the wicket, this one turns from around leg-stump line, Pattinson punches, gets the edge with the sharp turn, ad Sehwag pouches a sharp one by his toes 161/8"
13,75,MA Starc,caught,SR Tendulkar,8,3,v Australia,Chennai,India,22-Feb-13,Test # 2074,ashwin-wkt-75,"65.5 Ashwin gets a second five-for for the match. No. 12 for him. Starc was not going to die wondering, but he was going to die nonetheless. This is tossed up high by Ashwin, too much for Starc to resist, the ball grips the surface, makes him mis-hit, and Tendulkar takes an easy catch at deepish mid-on 175/9"
14,76,PJ Hughes,caught,MS Dhoni,19,1,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-76,"21.2 Ashwin strikes, he's conceded a run and is into his sixth over, and has now taken out Hughes, but what a take from Dhoni, on the second attempt, tossed up, good length, middle and off, spins away, Hughes cuts, edges, it pops out of Dhoni;s gloves, but the keeper recovers to throw himself to his left and take the ball even as it comes down 63/4"
14,77,DA Warner,bowled,,26,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-77,"19.6 the change of angle works for Ashwin. Warner tries to sweep it as this is pitched outside leg, but it is that awkward sweeping length between the too full and lenght region. Warner misses, and the ball turns to hit the prone leg stump. Dhoni's reaction suggests it was his idea to get Ashwin to move over the stumps 56/1"
14,78,PJ Hughes,bowled,,0,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-78,"23.3 Australia are sweeping themselves out of the Test. That angle is working like a charm. Tossed up outside leg, Hughes looks to sweep, but he has got too far across, and is hit on the glove, and the ball rolls onto the stumps. Ashwin can't believe Hughes has taken the bait too 56/2"
14,79,GJ Maxwell,lbw,,8,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-79,"54.1 that's plumb lbw. Carrom ball. Lovely use of it. Using it for the lesser batsmen and not for the top order. Anyway this wicket was a-coming. Maxwell has hardly looked assured. This drifts in towards the pads, is full, and Maxwell thinks he can flick it square. He has not read the ball at all. It pitches, turns the other way, and hits the back pad in front of middle and off. Very good use of the variation: sparing and against a lesser batsman 123/7"
14,80,MS Wade,caught,V Sehwag,10,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-80,"58.1 falling like nine pins here. Will Australia declare now? Tossed up wide outside off, Wade pushes in hope, gets a soft edge, Sehwag accepts it with glee at slip 130/9"
14,81,JL Pattinson,lbw,,0,3,v Australia,Hyderabad,India,02-Mar-13,Test # 2076,ashwin-wkt-81,"66.6 it's all over at the HCA Stadium. Ashwin gets five. Full, straight and flat. Beats the inside edge, it is deemed to be going straight on to hit the stumps. Pitches in front of leg, does it straighten enough? Dharmasena thinks so 131/10"
15,82,EJM Cowan,caught,V Kohli,86,1,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-82,"77.6 finally Cowan is caught. Finally Kohli holds one. And finally Ashwin gets reward for some superb bowling today. Again tossed up nicely, dipping on Cowan, who defends from the crease. The ball pitches full around middle and off, then turns away, takes the edge, and Kohli swallows the sitter at slip 198/4"
15,83,XJ Doherty,lbw,,5,1,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-83,"141.5 India will have to bat before lunch. Tossed up on middle and leg, holds its line a bit, hits him in front of leg. Did it straighten enough? I don't think so, but he has been given 408/10"
15,84,PJ Hughes,lbw,,69,3,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-84,"48.3 that looks like a bad decision. Easily missing the leg stump. Short of a length, middle and leg, doesn't straighten enough. Given. A strange one from Dar. Even the impact was possibly outside leg 123/6"
15,85,BJ Haddin,lbw,,30,3,v Australia,Mohali,India,14-Mar-13,Test # 2081,ashwin-wkt-85,"71.1 carrom ball. Gets the breakthrough. Very well bowled. The legbreak at 90ks, pitches middle and leg, Haddin hasn't picked it, has his outside edge beaten, and is hit plumb in front. This is not a tailender; he has done Haddin in with the carrom ball 179/9"
16,86,EJM Cowan,bowled,,38,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-86,"32.6 and this is at least the third batsman this series that Ashwin has bowled around the legs on the sweep, and bowling from over the stumps. So this is no lucky dismissal. He has planned this. Tossed up outside leg, turning towards the stumps. Cowan is on the sweep, misses the line, and is bowled. On the other hand, it is pretty soft for Australia to keep on losing wickets in this manner 106/3"
16,87,MS Wade,caught,M Vijay,2,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-87,"40.4 down the wicket to kick this away, but the extra bounce hits him high on the pad. Silly point catches it, the fielders go up in unison, Aleem Dar has no hesitation in giving him. I think Wade might be unlucky here. I haven't seen a clear edge. Perhaps the umpire was done in by how high this went, perhaps he was done in by the proximity of the bat to the pad. Oh it's the bat hitting the pad that has created the second noise. Wade can consider himself unlucky 117/5"
16,88,MG Johnson,bowled,,3,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-88,"53.6 Johnson is stunned. He has seen a ghost. Actually he has just not picked a carrom ball. This is a length ball, on off, Johnson thinks he can leave it alone, but the ball turns against the angle and knocks the off stump over. He just stands there stunned for various seconds. Dhoni's celebratory reaction suggests this is a pre-discussed dismissal. For many seconds, Johnson thought it was a stumping appeal. Then he asks, ""Bowled?"" 136/7"
16,89,SPD Smith,caught,AM Rahane,46,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-89,"81.2 sharp offbreak, sharp catch. Rahane's first Test contribution with no ""sub"" next to his name. This is quick, dipping, and Smith is nowhere near it in defence. The ball is allowed time to turn and hits the inside edge for a quick catch to Rahane at short leg 189/8"
16,90,PM Siddle,bowled,,51,1,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-90,"102.1 bowled'im. Ashwin has a five-for. Sensational stats: nine five-fors in 16 Tests. Finally breaks through Siddle's defence. This is a natural variation from the wicket. An offbreak, on a length outside off, Siddle defends, but the ball doesn;t turn as much as the balls have been turning, and the off stump is flattened 243/9"
16,91,PJ Hughes,lbw,,6,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-91,"13.4 lbw! But was that hitting the stumps? Ashwin drifted the ball into the left-hander from round the wicket, pitching on leg stump and ripping the offbreak sharply. Hughes came forward to defend and was beaten by the turn. The ball hit his back pad in front of off stump but I think the turn would have taken it past off stump. The umpire did not think so 41/3"
16,92,PM Siddle,stumped,MS Dhoni,50,3,v Australia,Delhi,India,22-Mar-13,Test # 2085,ashwin-wkt-92,"46.3 Siddle's been stumped! Clever bowling from Ashwin. Australia have been dismissed. Siddle charged Ashwin, and perhaps that was becoming predictable. Ashwin bowled the ball wide outside off stump, Siddle lunged at it but it was out of reach. Dhoni was ready and waiting too, collecting quickly and lunging back towards the stumps to break them with Siddle well out 164/10"
17,93,V Permaul,caught,R Ashwin,14,1,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-93,67.6 caught and bowled! Ashwin drew Permaul into the drive with a flighted ball that dipped on the right-hander. Permaul came forward but was beaten in flight and ended up chipping it straight back to the bowler 211/8
17,94,S Chanderpaul,bowled,,36,1,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-94,"76.6 he's bowled him! Chanderpaul's played down the wrong line and the ball's clipped off stump. It was the quicker ball and it pitched outside off stump and skidded on while kolding its line, Chanderpaul played back and tried to defend. He just missed it. 233/9"
17,95,KOA Powell,lbw,,36,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-95,"30.4 lbw! That's right in front. Ashwin flighted the ball into the left-hander from round the wicket, Powell could have been forward to that but he played back. The ball pitched around off and middle, straightened a little, and kept very low to beat Powell's defence and hit the pad. 101/2"
17,96,DM Bravo,caught,RG Sharma,37,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-96,"34.3 caught at point! The well-set Bravo is gone to a loose shot. Ashwin pitched outside off and got the ball to bounce a bit more. Bravo went back to cut and hit it in the air, the fielder dived forward at point to take the catch as the ball dipped on him 120/4"
17,97,TL Best,caught,PP Ojha,3,3,v West Indies,Eden Gardens,India,06-Nov-13,Test # 2101,ashwin-wkt-97,51.3 caught at deep midwicket! Best has a wry smile as he walks off the field. Ashwin flighted the ball beautifully and it dipped on Tino and beat him in the flight. He slogged across the line and mis-hit it straight to Ojha on the boundary 159/9
18,98,DM Bravo,caught,MS Dhoni,29,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-98,"24.4 he walks! Big outside edge as Dhoni leaps off his feet after collecting a good, sharp catch. It was tossed up on leg stump, so he had to play at that. But this time there was turn and bounce and Bravo's cheery little innings comes to a close 86/2"
18,99,N Deonarine,caught,M Vijay,21,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-99,"48.4 Oh, Vijay you beauty. That is an excellent catch to give Ashwin has his 99th wicket. There was some bounce again in this delivery, pitching on middle and turning away. He plods forward but played at it with hard hands, as the edge flies to gully. Vijay dives to his left and grabs a good 'un 162/6"
18,100,DJG Sammy,caught,RG Sharma,0,1,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-100,"48.6 but now he's gone! Horrible shot as he goes for a wild slog and the West Indies captain goes as soon as he came. It was a simple off spinner, pitching on middle and turning only a bit. But playing across the line, he gets a leading edge that went straight in the air and Rohit Sharma settles under it to give Ashwin his 100th Test wicket, the fifth quickest to the mark 162/7"
18,101,KOA Powell,caught,Mohammed Shami,9,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-101,"6.2 oh that's a waste of a wicket! Powell gives it away by lofting it straight to long off, the lone man in the deep. He came charging down the pitch and had to wait a little longer as Ashwin delivered it at a slower pace, and that probably messed up his timing. Shami at long-off came running forward and took a good, low diving catch 15/1"
18,102,DM Bravo,caught,M Vijay,11,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-102,"12.2 and they are falling in a heap! Ashwin comes round the wicket, gets it to turn and bounce, it catches the outside edge and settles into the palms of Vijay at second slip.. It's all turning into a bad dream for West Indies 43/3"
18,103,S Chanderpaul,lbw,,41,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-103,"38.2 that was plumb! Tossed up on the half stump, a tentative Chanderpaul was half forward and his bat was behind the front pad as he looked to defend forward, a nothing shot really, that skidded through and struck the front pad, very easy decision 157/7"
18,104,S Shillingford,lbw,,8,3,v West Indies,Wankhede,India,14-Nov-13,Test # 2102,ashwin-wkt-104,"44.4 lbw off the sweep! 9 down now, tossed up and he gets down to sweep, played too early, struck on the thigh, plumb and an easy decision 185/9"
