He delivered the first bouncer of the day outside off stump and Powell shaped to pull. He had to take that from quite wide outside off stump and he got an edge that lobbed up towards mid-off. Bhuvneshwar did well to run backwards from extra cover and take the catch.,,InField,"1. KOA Powell c B Kumar b Shami
